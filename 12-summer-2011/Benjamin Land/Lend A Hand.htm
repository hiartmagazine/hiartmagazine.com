			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Ben is 
			out of jail again. Five minutes ago the phone rang and I picked up. 
			The gentle voice of a twenty-nine year old man who flew above the 
			violence and hopelessness of his circumstances, informed me quietly 
			that the judge had moved him from Riverside County Jail to a halfway 
			house. Ben had found the soft spot in a California judge’s heart – 
			Only he could do that! A convicted multiple offender, and she’d said 
			‘You seem like a good man. I don’t want to see you spend the rest of 
			your life in prison.’ She was right. Ben is one of the best men I’ve 
			known. But he’s spent more of his adult life in prison than out.</font></p>
			<p align="justify">
			<font size="4">Twenty years ago I’d been in the asphalt yard of my 
			studio in South Central Los Angeles. Behind an eight foot high 
			chain-link, razor wire fence, I hefted boxes of clay from a pallet 
			around back of the three thousand foot Quonset hut, where kilns, 
			molds and potter’s wheels hidden from street view, announced my 
			presence to no one but high flying pigeons. It doesn’t pay to 
			advertise in South Central.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Outside the fence, two young boys tossed a 
			football, and the nine year old with nappy head and Cheshire cat 
			smile beamed through the wire hexagons, calling to me, “Yo, Mister! 
			Lemme in!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">I looked skeptically at the kid with the football 
			in his hand and challenged his trust. “Throw your ball over.”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Ben squinted through the chain link, then looked 
			back at the ball for a brief moment, making the risk assessment. He 
			cocked his arm and tossed the football in a high arc over the razor 
			wire. I caught it, hesitated for a moment like I might just walk 
			away, then unlocked the gate and let the two kids in.</font></span></td>

			remembered – My first day arriving at my newly rented studio in 
			South Central, I pulled up in front of the padlocked gates. In the

			forbidding-looking men with long dreadlocks glared over at me

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“Hello!” I beamed, introducing myself, briefly

			the huge chalkboard I used to design my work, and tried to teach 
			him. He was nothing but frustrated. The next day I came into the 
			studio and my eight foot chalk board was covered in wild, off color 
			graffiti. Cowering in the corner, Ben waited for me to be pissed at 
			him.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“<i>Damn</i>, Ben!” I said impressed. 
			Every profanity was perfectly formed and spelled! I erased an F, 
			replacing it with a B. “What’s <i>this</i> say?”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Ben was still paralyzed, waiting for the obscenity

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">I whooped and we spent the afternoon permutating 
			all the profanity he seemed to be able to spell easily into a

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Ben’s tagging name was ‘The Rat’, emblematic of

			There are very few businesses you can see from the streets in South

			through iron bars. The hand painted sign on the game room across the

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">
			<img border="0" src="../../Short%20Stories/The%20Prince/blood.gif" width="169" height="218" align="left">That was small stuff though. The real wars in

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">But in the day, South Central wasn’t a dangerous

			Westside home, where Ben would hang out with my girlfriend and her 
			daughter (an adopted niece) – he was a big brother in our odd little

			instant photo booths at a mall. Glancing at the motley collection of 
			faces smiling back, my three year old grinned, “My family!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify">
			<font size="4">My girlfriend smiled wryly, “A Mexican, a Jew, an 
			Indian and a Black! Quite a family.”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Then Cathy called me one day. “Ben’s locked up in 
			the asylum.”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“What happened?!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“I just couldn’t control that boy anymore. With 
			that temper! I just took him down and had him committed.”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">It had been a couple of years I’d known Ben, and 
			he’d grown quite a bit. Now he’d become big enough that his mother’s 
			threats and beatings no longer intimidated him. He’d take the 
			extension cord from her when she tried to whip him. Just a few weeks 
			ago she’d called me on the phone, “You gotta talk him down,” she 
			told tell me. “He’s got a chair, says he’s gonna whoop us!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">I got on the phone with Ben. “I can’t take it no 
			more!” he said. “They just pushin’ me too far!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">A year before Ben had come running into the studio 
			one morning, teary-eyed. “What happened, Ben?”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“My momma’s boyfriend beat her up. I wanna kill 
			him, But I’m too small!” he wept. “He gone now, but it keep happenin’!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">After Ben calmed down I told him that there was 
			only one reason a man would beat on a woman, and I held my thumb and 
			forefinger and inch apart. He looked at me puzzled. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“Really small dick.” Ben laughed at my joke, but 
			never forgot the point.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">
			<img border="0" src="../../Short%20Stories/The%20Prince/helicopter.gif" width="255" height="204" align="left">So as Ben threatened his mother and sister with 
			the chair, I spoke to remind him over the phone, “You know the only 
			reason a man beats a woman?” I could almost see the smile creeping 
			over Ben’s face. He put down the chair, and for a while there was 
			peace.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Afraid of how this had all played out, I went 
			right over to visit Ben at the asylum. First thing he came up to me 
			beaming and he asked, “What I have to do to stay here? They treat me 
			good. The food’s good. We play ping pong and pool. These people 
			crazy, but they <i>like</i> me! You think if I cut myself they maybe 
			think I’m suicidal and let me stay?”</font></span></td>

			Central.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">During the riots when businesses 
			were looted and burnt, my warehouse was ransacked. All of the

			taken, his work smashed or stolen. But the corner where my remaining 
			work and possessions were housed was pristine and untouched – my

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">
			<img border="0" src="../../Short%20Stories/The%20Prince/blood-crip.gif" width="473" height="337" align="right">Watching Ben come and go through the years, the 
			neighbors had wondered in one by one. A few weeks after I’d met the 
			Rastas, a tiny old lady named Violet, maybe four feet nine came up 
			the driveway. She told me all about herself. She’d owned a ‘sportin’ 
			house’ down in Texas. It’d been a top class joint with restaurant 
			and ‘rooms for both the boys <i>and </i>the girls’. I finally 
			understood that a ‘sportin’ house’ was a brothel.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">After the riots Violet disappeared for two weeks

			“Yep, when the riots came and they was lootin’ in them big

			<p align="justify"><font size="4">After 
			the riots there was an uneasy peace in Ben’s home. South Central was 
			subtly changed. A ghost of awareness of the real situation there 
			haunted the Westside. South Central was harder for the well off to 
			ignore for a while. Well meaning liberal zealots paraded projects 
			where the residues of destruction in the ghetto were to be 
			reconstructed into emblems of liberty – art of the poor, by the poor 
			and for the poor. I remember during one of the infamous 
			‘reconstruction’ meetings, one Black man from the neighborhood 
			standing up. We’d just been informed of a project touting a 
			notorious Westside artist’s intention to build monuments from the 
			residues of the riots. The Black man said, “For my part, I grew up 
			here with <i>everything</i> I ever owned second hand. Does our art 
			even have to be made of garbage?!”</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Before I 
			left L.A. Ben entered an apprenticeship program to become an auto 
			mechanic. He attended after school and he loved it. He finally had 
			leverage. Maybe he would be okay. That helped me a little with the 
			guilt of leaving him behind in the luminous smog, anonymity and 
			despair, spawned by the Los Angeles sprawl. A few months later Cathy 
			pulled Ben out if his mechanic’s program to punish him for refusing 
			to buy her cigarettes. Things got worse for Ben quickly after that.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">I visited occasionally over the next years as Ben 
			grew to manhood. Although he sprouted to six foot two and 220 pounds 
			a sideways glance from me could still convince him I could take him 
			in a wrestling match – a child’s perspective become fantasy long 
			ago. Cathy died of emphysema, attached to an oxygen tank, spooning 
			cornstarch from a box, chain-smoking cigarettes till the end. When 
			that end came, Ben wept like a little boy.</font></span></td>

			<img border="0" src="../../Short%20Stories/The%20Prince/looting.gif" width="800" height="302" align="left">So at 
			eighteen Ben was on his own. After a few months on the street, he 
			got married and set up house with a sweet Mexican girl he’d fallen 
			in love with. She had a daughter. They lived in a housing project 
			until his first child was born. Then the family was evicted – the 
			apartment was not allowed to house more than three. Ben called me, 
			desperate for a job. I called everyone I still knew in L.A. but no 
			jobs were available to an intimidating Black man without a high 
			school diploma or any real work experience.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">
			But there were areas where Ben was skilled and experienced. He could 
			get along with anyone. He knew everyone. Ben started dealing drugs, 
			small time at first, to support his new family.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">One night he slept over on the sofa at a friend’s 
			house. Apparently the friend had offended the wrong person, because 
			in the night someone entered the house, found Ben sleeping on the 
			sofa, and put a gun to his hip, shooting him five times. They moved 
			on and shot everyone else in the house, too. Ben died on the way to 
			the hospital. He was revived five times. Three months later when he 
			was finally released from the hospital he walked with a limp.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">I flew him out to stay with me in my country home 
			in Hawaii, but after just a few days the silence and unfamiliarity 
			of the rain forest spooked him. Soon he was back in L.A. dealing 
			again. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Over the last ten years, Ben’s been in and out of 
			jail, always for possession or parole violations. His wife waited 
			for him the first time he was locked up, but the second was too 
			much. She left him. Ben took to the streets. Gangrene attacked his 
			bad foot. When he was finally arrested for parole violation, the 
			police rushed him to the hospital and two of his toes were 
			amputated. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">The time after that, it was half his foot. When 
			the phone rang this time, Ben had just come out of surgery. His leg 
			is gone from the knee down now. But he’s going into a program – a 
			real structured one that might give him a chance he needs. He says 
			it’s over. He’s done with drugs. He wants to see his children grow. 
			He still loves his wife. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">It’s hard to think of whether Ben made bad 
			decisions. Three twenty-five an hour at McDonald’s or a hundreds of 
			dollars a day on the streets with friends to back him up, so he 
			could take care of his family. I don’t know. Is it really over? The 
			doctor told Ben if he lets himself go again, it’ll surely be his 
			life next time.</font></span></td>
