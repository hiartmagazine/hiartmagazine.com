							Ever since its inception in the 18th century, the 
							idea of enlightenment and progress has been the 
							guiding star of Western civilization – an idea that 
							seems like an asymptotic line that is never destined 
							to reach its goal<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u><a href="#[2]">[2]</a></u></font>. 
							It’s quasi-religious status, which has remained into 
							this postmodern age, is responsible for many 
							magnificent accomplishments of Western science and 
							culture. It is a truism that we are all paying an 
							inordinate price for the grandeur of our 
							civilization, but despite the obviousness of its 
							pitfalls, we are left with few tools with which to 
							tackle this difficulty. One of the tools has been an 
							increasing acknowledgement of the coexistence and 
							validity of different cultural models, based on a 
							variety of qualities of complexity and expression.
							</font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The “other”, as viewed from 
							Western perspective, has always had a peculiar 
							status of being considered both extraordinary 
							and inferior. In his landmark work <i>Orientalism</i>, 
							Edward Said points to the origins of the Western way of 
							dealing with foreign cultures and societies, whereby 
							a sort of polarization of an idealized “other” 
							against the devalued “other”, is created
							<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u><a href="#[3]">[3]</a></u></font>. 
							In neither case is the essence of a culture grasped 
							in its full reality. Since then (1978), thanks to 
							the major overhaul of ethnographic and sociological 
							studies, we are in a much better position to view 
							cultures of the world without bias and 
							preconception. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To come back to our topic: the 
							first step towards true cultural pluralism lies in 
							acknowledging the “other” as oneself, and that means 
							a deep study of social and aesthetic aspects of a 
							cultural identity. It will not do to just 
							superficially “make over” a culture in order to make 
							it really a valid aesthetic object of biculturalism 
							or any other sort of cultural amalgam. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The next step, I believe, is 
							the synthesis of elements of particular cultures on 
							their deepest level<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u><a href="#[4]">[4]</a></u></font>. 
							The various syntheses produced by African music are 
							a case in point. Blues, Jazz, Gospel, Afro Cuban and 
							others, are all successful amalgams of native 
							African music with European musical heritage. In 
							visual arts, the fusion of Native American sand 
							painting<i> </i>and abstract expressionism in <i>
							action painting</i> of Jackson Pollock, the use of 
							Byzantine iconography in work of Modigliani or, more 
							recently, the inventive amalgam of Japanese 
							woodprints and Pop art by Masami Teraoka, all 
							represent successful syntheses of diverse cultural 
							blueprints. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">What might not be obvious at 
							first sight is that some of these trajectories are 
							geographically defined, the other, historically. 
							Pollock’s <i>action painting</i> involves<i> </i>
							Native American folk art, which is geographically 
							separate from Western Art, Modigliani’s and 
							Teraoka’s involve arts that are separated 
							temporally. Considered from this perspective, modern 
							and postmodern paradigms appear as two different 
							interpretations of the process of artistic 
							synthesis, instead of two discrete movements. <br>

								<p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
								The concept of modernity as progress is easily 
								grasped in science and technology; it is an 
								altogether different situation in the arts. Most 
								thinking artists know that there is nothing like 
								progress in the arts: the irreversible arrow of 
								art history is still a subject taught at schools 
								and academies throughout the Western sphere, but 
								no one in their right mind would say that music 
								or visual art conceived at a newer date is 
								“better” than the one conceived at a later. 
								However, since most powerful cultural 
								institutions belong to Europe, North America or 
								Australia, standards and concepts used in 
								evaluating arts come from these geopolitical 
								entities. </font></p>
								<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To 
								emphasize another point: the historical 
								narrative of art has so far been equated with 
								the Western narrative, which at this point still 
								does not have serious competition. In 
								consequence, Western cultural institutions 
								perceive art coming from non-Western world 
								primarily as folk art. Such “authentic folk art” 
								is considered valuable and is regularly 
								exhibited in museums throughout the Western 
								world. It is a very different situation with 
								non-Western contemporary art, which is still 
								usually shown under the auspices of the 
								occidental historical narrative. That is to say: 
								for contemporary art to be considered “valid”, 
								it simply has to belong to Western art 
								history- either as a reflection of one of the 
								many –isms or as one of their offspring (such as 
								say, neo-dada etc.). </font></p>
								<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are some attempts at 
								this point at creating new paradigms built 
								around different cultural perspectives, notably 
								Shmuel Eisenstadt’s <i>multiple modernities</i> 
								concept, which is conceived as “continual 
								constitution and reconstitution of a 
								multiplicity of cultural programs”<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u><a href="#[5]">[5]</a></u></font>. 
								While this concept seems very attractive as a 
								new sociological concept, its application in the 
								arts aesthetic appears much less 
								straightforward. </font></p>
								<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Let’s take a familiar 
								example: <i>Les Demoiselle d’Avignon</i>, 
								Picasso’s landmark achievement which is often 
								considered the beginning of Modernism in Western 
								art history, is said to have been influenced by 
								the aesthetics of African sculpture<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u><a href="#[6]">[6]</a></u></font>. 
								If that is true, it means that African folk art 
								has been instrumental in creating the modernist 
								paradigm of twentieth century paintings. A 
								similar statement can be made about many other 
								contemporary works across diverse media and 
								idioms. </font></p>
								<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Many modernist 
								masterpieces are bicultural or multicultural by 
								the very nature of their creative processes. 
								Implicitly, the African or other folk art then 
								is already an integral part of the Western 
								concept of modernity. Looked at from this angle, 
								it is not artistically revolutionary to simply 
								“make over” folk music by, say, using electric 
								instruments, lightshow or Internet in order to 
								make it modern. In this case (as in innumerable 
								other instances) the modern technology is used 
								to make a superficial transformation, instead of 
								deep, structural ones. <br>

											It would appear then that 
											multiculturalism, although a new 
											phenomena in sociology and cultural 
											studies, has been an essential 
											ingredient of Modern art since its 
											inception<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u>[7]</u></font>. 
											Instead of one internationally 
											accepted (Western) style and unified 
											aesthetic, we have a coexistence of 
											various cultural centers: Asian, 
											African etc. What is fundamentally 
											different between the international 
											art of the preceding periods and the 
											present Global art is a different 
											geopolitical power balance. Western Art history had a unified 
											stylistic profile primarily because 
											its origins were in European 
											history, which later included North 
											America and Australia. Rather than 
											being a new or original concept, 
											today’s </font><b>
											<font face="Arial">multicultural art 
											is an acknowledgment of a culturally 
											decentered world. </font></p>
											</b>
											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Arial">Does that mean a 
											coexistence of various stylistic 
											orientations? In certain media, such 
											as music, the coexistence of 
											different stylistic orientations has 
											been a given for some time, 
											especially in eclectic cultural 
											milieus, such as the U.S. The visual 
											arts, on the other hand, are much 
											more dependent on the occidental 
											historical narrative. It is a 
											complex question why that is, but 
											certainly one of the main reasons is 
											that the very nature of a medium 
											greatly defines its use: while 
											visual arts have delineated 
											difference between art object and 
											the serially reproduced craft 
											object, music does not. The primary 
											process of objectifying music is 
											serial reproduction and the only 
											“authentic musical object” is still 
											a concert<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u>[8]</u></font>. 
											While a concert, CD or webcast can 
											be bought, it cannot be personally 
											possessed as a tangible physical 
											object, the same way that an art 
											object can. </font></p>
											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Arial">Perhaps primarily 
											because of this factor the art 
											object still retains its aura of 
											authenticity and uniqueness and is 
											consequently greatly dependent on 
											the Western history of art, in order 
											to have its financial worth 
											assessed. Music, on the other hand, 
											primarily measures its worth by the 
											volume of the sales of its products; 
											its value is therefore not as 
											dependent on its adherence to the 
											modernist paradigm. One need only 
											take a cursory glance on the 
											Internet to see these differences 
											stand out immediately. </font></p>
											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Arial">If <i>multiple 
											modernities</i> theory gives us a 
											good starting point, there is a lot 
											of work to be done in 
											conceptualizing contemporary culture 
											and art from a philosophical 
											(aesthetic) angle. Certainly a 
											multidisciplinary research spanning 
											a wide spectrum of subjects, from 
											evolutionary biology to multimedia 
											technologies, could bring us closer 
											to a more comprehensive 
											understanding of artistic 
											creativity, while giving us 
											guidelines towards future programs

							Just like “theories of everything” in physics, a 
							longing for global art aesthetics might be an 
							offspring of an essentially monotheistic view of the 
							world. As mentioned in the previous section of this 
							article, the idea of a global art is a conceptual 
							extrapolation of the synthetic processes that have 
							been already in action since the inception of the 
							modernist paradigm. Though partial in actions, these 
							processes point out to amalgamations of diverse 
							cultures and perhaps to further structural 
							transformations of the contemporary arts. </font>
							</p>
							<p><font face="Arial">While entertaining this idea, 
							we have to be aware of various historical and 
							structural differences that these cultural profiles 
							entail. For one, we cannot put under the same 
							aesthetic umbrella Art that is as far removed as 
							say, Tuvan throat singing and West African 
							Polyphony. We could however, construct a common 
							aesthetic for certain geopolitical regions or zones 
							of cultural influence. For example, such modal 
							frameworks as Indian <i>raga </i>or its Arabic 
							equivalent <i>maqam </i>can be connected to include 
							subregions of the Balkans on the West and African 
							Sahara, on the South. Similar modal language of the 
							Spanish <i>Cante Flamenco</i> idiom could be 
							considered as an interpolation due to Moorish 
							invasion and Roma immigration to the Iberian 
							Peninsula in the middle ages. </font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial">As there are no comparative 
							taxonomies of world cultures to my knowledge as yet, 
							a global language of the arts seems like a faraway 
							dream. On the other hand, many formal concepts and 
							techniques derived from either Western or 
							non-Western art can be used as abstract reference 
							points towards creating universal aesthetic 
							syntaxes. The confluence of various cultural 
							concepts and techniques could be viewed as a world art 
							glossary - perhaps a new Babylonian tower of Global art could be created. </font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial">What if, however, the true 
							confluence of cultures means an acknowledgment of 
							principles of artistic creation that are 
							complementary in their opposition? This may mean an 
							acceptance of simultaneity of ideas and axioms: 
							tribal visions of the world going hand in hand with 
							Western ideas of progress and enlightenment. What if 
							the true confluence of cultures means a different 
							view of the function of art, a concept called by 
							Ellen Dissanayke <i>species-centered art</i> – a 
							concept of art that would include, an infrastructure 
							of collectivism and humanness as well as uniqueness 
							and originality of the modern individual? To quote Dissanayke: “Cultures and their institutions, 
							practices and artifacts – different though they be – 
							are means of satisfying fundamental human needs. And 
							what those needs are, as well as broader range of 
							workable satisfactions, is to be discovered by 
							accepting the reality that humanity is the 
							underlying landscape upon which one approaches (but 
							not with which one replaces) the humanities. Both 
							have made us what we are<font COLOR="#0000ff" size="1"><u>[9]</u></font>.”
