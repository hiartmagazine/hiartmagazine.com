								Initially, groups were physically isolated or 
				behaviorally separated by features such as: competition for 
				territory, great distance, physical barriers, unfamiliarity with 
				local adaptations in behavior and culture. In more recent times 
				group identification and inter-group competition, became based 
				on differences in political, social and belief systems, and a 
				few physical features – population variations. In addition, 
				group conflict might also result, as earlier, from the desire 
				for more territory or resources, differences in views and 
				opinions – and even just plain envy! The various human groupings 
				came to involve strong group loyalties through common 
				interests, beliefs and other concepts, and these led to binding

				<p>Many groups in the earlier years of human history, and

				There is a vast collection of literature on ‘race’ considering the 
definitions of the postulated groups, and specifying their characteristics. I 
briefly describe below just a few salutary examples, mainly from books such as:
<i>The Races of Europe</i> (1899) by WZ Ripley; ‘The Races in Europe’ (in: <i>On 
Living in a Revolution</i>) by Julian Huxley (1946); <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i> 
(1981) by Stephen Jay Gould; and <i>The Race Gallery </i>(1995) by Marek Kohn.<p>
It was in Europe after the Renaissance, that for some of the geographically 
separated, or the physical, cultural or political differences between groups, 
that the term <i>race</i> was introduced (Julian Huxley, 1946, <i>On Living in 
a Revolution</i>, p. 163). What, then, is the meaning (biologically and 
culturally) of the term <i>race</i> and what are the implications for human 
groupings of those different interpretations and applications?</p>
				<p>Other than ‘races’ being defined by language or religion, many 
anthropologists have used a diverse number of parameters to define populations 
in humankind. As people from Europe explored the then unknown world of Africa 
and the East, skin pigmentation was one of the first commonly used features. The 
subdivisions of skin color defined were: white, yellow, brown, red or black. 
Other features, early introduced for human population subdivisions, included: 
skull (cranium and face) measurements, nose shape, eye color and shape, hair 
texture, body size and proportions, and even behavioral and cultural features.
				</p>
<p>As a point of historic interest in defining humankind as ‘species and their 
subgroups’, behavioral and cultural features were included in the classification 
of Carolus Linnaeus (1707 – 1778), whose hierarchical system of group naming 
(taxonomy: species, genus, family, class, phylum) is basically still used today. 
Linnaeus classified humankind as including two species: the first, <i>H. sapien</i>s, 
varied by education (culture) and situation (geography); the second species, <i>
H. monstrosus</i>, varied by climate or art, the latter term meaning manner or 
behavior. Further, within <i>Homo sapiens</i> he included 5 varieties: Europeans 
– sanguine, gentle, acute, inventive – governed by laws; Africans – phlegmatic, 
relaxed, crafty, indolent, negligent – governed by caprice (whims). The second 
species <i>H. monstrosus</i> included six varieties, e.g. Patagonians – large 
indolent, and Hottentots – one testis, less fertile (pp. 283 – 4). [Linnaeus’ 
source for ‘Hottentots’ having one testis is not known, but it is quite 
incorrect!]<br>

							In 1853, Friedrich Max Müller, an eminent philologist and philosopher, 
introduced the term ‘Aryan’ as a <i>linguistic</i> group, and also<i> a ‘race’</i>. 
The idea of its being a ‘race’ was criticized at the time quite severely by some 
– and later, more widely, including by Müller himself! (in: Huxley, p. 173). 
Also, with regard to ‘behavioral and cultural’ being included in biological race 
classifications, in 1899, Ripley clearly stated (on page 1 of his book) that: 
“Race, properly speaking, is responsible only for those peculiarities, mental or 
bodily, which are transmitted with constancy along the lines of direct physical

							Despite the wide rejection of the concept of a ‘race’ called ‘Aryans’, some 
Germans – notably the Nazis – later claimed those mythical people to have 
existed, and been: tall, fair and long-headed, and the ancestors of another 
hypothetical race, the ‘Teutons’. These proposals were just two of the many, 
similar, invalid ‘racial’ groups, such as ‘Caucasoid’, ‘Mongoloid’ and 
‘Negroid’, postulated during a very complex period (1850–1950) of so-called 
‘racial history’. One prominent contributor who expanded and compounded these 
ideas during that time was the French, Count Joseph de Gobineau (1816 – 1882); 
he added to the list by introducing ‘races’, such as a ‘Nordic race’. <br>
							<br>
							Huxley (p. 171) provides a clever parody on these 19<sup>th</sup> – 20<sup>th</sup> 
Century false ideas of ‘races and lineages’, as exemplified by the 1939 – 1945, 
German, Nazi hierarchy. Huxley writes: “Thus our German neighbors have ascribed 
to themselves a Teutonic type that is fair, long-headed, tall, slender, 
unemotional, brave straightforward, gentle, and virile. Let us make a composite 
picture of a typical Teuton from the most prominent of the exponents of this 
view. Let him be physically as blond and mentally as unemotional as Hitler, 
physically as long-headed and mentally as direct as Rosenberg, as tall and 
truthful as Goebbels, as slender and gentle as Goering, and as manly and 
straightforward as Streicher.” Those familiar with the Nazi period in Germany 
will appreciate the sarcasm of the directly opposite features to those listed, 
as characterizing the leading figures in the Nazi hierarchy.</font></span></td>

				PART 3<br>
				&nbsp;</font><p>With 
								regard to the postulate of a ‘Jewish race’, what 
								is the evidence? The Jews originated as the 
								Hebrews, a small, nomadic lineage or group of 
								lineages (tribe) in Ur in Chaldea (Babylon; in 
								the south of present day Iran), according to 
								their calendar, 5771 years ago. They moved 
								under the leadership of their patriarch, 
								Abraham, into Canaan (variously defined as 
								present day Israel and some parts of the 
								surrounding countries). Thereafter, mostly by 
								enforced migrations, they spread westward across 
								north Africa and north into Asia and Europe. 
								During the Roman period they followed the path 
								of the Roman legions through Europe and later, 
								mainly from large settlements in eastern Europe 
								and western Asia, they moved into many of the 
								other populated parts of the world.<br>
					<br>
					During the course of their dispersion (the <i>
								Diaspora</i>), the Jews intermarried with, and 
								had numerous converts from, the many populations 
								amongst which they had settled. To quote Huxley 
								again (p. 175), today, “Jews are no more a 
								distinctly sharply marked ‘race’ than are 
								Germans or English.” and, “The Jews of the Bible 
								were of mixed descent and the Jewish communities 
								have come to resemble the local populations in 
								many respects.”. Similar histories can be 
								described for many other so-called ‘races’, 
								notably the Roma (the gypsies), who ‘originated’ 
								in India; and it is salutary to recall that it 
								was the Jews and the gypsies that were the 
								primary targets of the Nazi policy of ‘ethnic 
								cleansing’ in Germany during the 1930s and 
								1940s. </p>

				<p>In more recent years the list of defining 
								features used for ‘race’ definition has been 
								extended to include: blood groups, the genetic 
								functions and features of the DNA molecule – and 
								even I.Q. (Intelligence Quotient)! </p>
								<p>Blood groups, of which there are a 
								considerable number, have been extensively 
								studied in many populations because of their 
								importance in aspects such as: the immune system 
								– resistance to disease, for their significance 
								in blood transfusions. Related to these groups, 
								is the hemoglobin of blood cells which, similar 
								to some types of the blood cells, has been 
								demonstrated to be associated with resistance to 
								two types of malaria. The frequencies of the 
								different blood groups vary in people from 
								different populations, and the ABO, MN and Rh 
								groups, in particular have been studied in many 
								human populations. One extensive, tentative 
								classification into six groups was proposed in 
								1950 by WC Boyd (<i>Genetics and the Races of 
								Man,</i> 1950, p. 268). The postulated groups 
								were: Early European, European (Caucasoid), 
								African (Negroid), Asiatic (Mongoloid), American 
								Indian and Australoid. As with the earlier 
								featured studied, these again mainly follow 
								geographic, continental boundaries, and with 
								similar limitations and exceptions.</p>
								<p>With regard to DNA (<b>d</b>eoxyribo<b>n</b>ucleaic
								<b>a</b>cid), the structure and functions of 
								this chemical molecule is the basis for 
								understanding biological (genetic) inheritance 
								in all living forms. Some details of these are 
								briefly outlined later below; here, just note 
								that the frequencies of genes are another 
								feature utilized for defining populations. Using 
								these, however, already in the 1970’s an 
								important geneticist, Richard Lewontin: 
								“...disposed of most serious scientific racism by 
								showing how genetic differences between 
								individuals swamp those between races.” (in: <i>
								Nature via Nurture</i>, by Matt Ridley, 2003, p. 
								264</p>
								<p>Further, as in metrical features of the skull 
								and body, new statistical methods (multivariate 
								statistics) enable the combination of <i>numbers 
								of separate</i> dimensions (or other 
								observations) into a single figure to more 
								accurately compare groups of people and get 
								insights into their relationships (shared genes) 
								and biological history (migrations). For genetic 
								features, the figure called <i>genetic distance</i> 
								is the average measurement of the relatedness 
								between pairs of populations based on a number 
								of genetic traits. JC Long, Li Jie and ME Healy, 
								using 32 population samples, and 63 loci 
								(genes), found that the DNA sequences reveal 
								that: “...populations differ in the amount of 
								diversity that they harbor...(:)...they show 
								nested subsets...(,)...some populations belong to 
								more than one race...[and]...some do not belong to 
								any race at all.” (<i>Am. J. Phys. Anthrop</i>., 
								139:23 – 34, 2009). <br>

								<p>After World War II, when extensive IQ testing 
								became common in the U.S.A., a new feature 
								presented itself for use in ‘race’ definition. 
								Some tests, for example, showed that the African-American people in the U.S.A., on average, 
								scored 10 points <i>less</i> than those of 
								European (Caucasian) descent, whereas the 
								average score of individuals of Asian 
								(Mongoloid) ancestry scored several points <i>
								more</i> than the ’Europeans’. This sort of 
								result has led some writers to use such findings 
								to support a belief in ‘race’ differences (the 
								fallacy of ‘biological determinism’) – quite 
								recently, for example, RJ Herrnstein and C. 
								Murray, in <i>The Bell Curve</i> (1994). </p>
								<p>The IQ test was originally devised by Alfred 
								Binet in France in 1904, to identify children 
								with educational difficulties who might require 
								special education. His test involved a series of 
								tasks (written, visual, manual), from which to 
								assess an individual’s ‘mental age’. The IQ 
								score is determined from the result by dividing 
								the mental age by the chronological age, so that 
								the average score for a reference population is 
								100. The test now in use is the much modified 
								version, known as the Stanford-Binet IQ test.

<span LANG="EN"><font SIZE="4">In his book: <i>The Human Species</i> (8th. 
								Ed., 2010), John Relethford summarizes current 
								views on human races: “Studies of genetic 
								variation in the human species do not produce 
								results consistent with the race concept. 
								Instead we find evidence of geographic 
								differences..(–)..distances between human 
								groups, but with no clear boundaries between 
								them. Genetic variation is greatest within local 
								human populations..[and]..is strongly related to 
								geography and gene flow.” (p. 377). Migration 
								and distance separation by physical barriers; ‘<i>bottle 
								necks</i>’ – such as crossing between Africa and 
								Europe – and allowing only very slow or 
								periodic interchange; intermarriage at adjacent 
								borders (<i>gene flow</i>); and rapid changes in 
								new, small, well-separated groups (the <i>
								founder effect</i>). 
								<p>Regrettably, however, many aspects of the 
								early subdivisions of humankind remained in 
								vogue until quite recently (M. Kohn, <i>The Race 
								Gallery</i>, 1995). None, however, of those – 
								nor even those of the more recent classifications of humans 
								– conform to the most 
								common biological definition of subspecies or 
								races, the ‘75% rule’. The ‘rule’ states that: 
								75% of the individuals in each subspecies [often 
								synonymous with ‘race’] designated must be able 
								to be separated from all of those in each of the

								<p>The importance of being different.</p>
								</i>
								<p>The DNA of each individual is located in 22 
								pairs of homologous (similar; ‘autosomes’), and 
								one pair of non-homologous (dissimilar; ‘sex 
								determining’) <i>chromosomes</i>, which are 
								identically located in the nuclei of each cell 
								of the human body. At the time of conception, 
								each individual inherits a particular set (the
								<i>genome</i>) of pairs of constituent parts of 
								the DNA molecule (<i>genes</i>) – one of each 
								pair has been <i>randomly</i> chosen from one or 
								other of their two parents. The genes are each 
								found at a position (a <i>locus</i>) on a 
								chromosome. Each gene pair <i>predisposes</i> 
								(that is, has the potential) for the development 
								– or an aspect of the development – of a 
								particular trait, feature, process or behavior.
								</p>
								<p>However, before the final <i>expression </i>
								of a gene (that is, its manifestation in an 
								individual), it is subject to interaction with 
								any of the long, complex series of features to 
								which it is exposed in the course of its 
								conception-to-death environments. These include: 
								internal – other genes, chemicals; and external 
								– personal, social, cultural, or any of the 
								other, vast diversity of other life experience 
								to which individuals are exposed. From these 
								interactions the end result of a gene pair may 
								be modifications to its predisposed trait – or 
								even to its being completely turned <i>on</i> or
								<i>off</i>. Of special note are the early years’ 
								imprinting of individual backgrounds with regard 
								to: parents, society, environment and culture, 
								even economic status. </p>
								<p>The importance of comprehending this complex 
								process, starting from random gene selection 
								from each of their parents – and the many 
								events, which can later influence that 
								potential, is that:</p>
								<i>
								<p>Each human being is <b>unique</b> in their 
								particular combination of physical, 
								physiological and behavioral features</i>. </p>
								<p>As a result, between the millions of living 
								individuals, there is the vast range of 
								different attitudes, attributes and skills, 
								essential for the multiple, diverse activities 
								necessary in modern societies. But, in addition 
								to creating those basic individual 
								personalities, understanding genetic mechanisms 
								provides the necessary background for 
								appreciating the potential: for producing 
								medicines, of stem cell research, genetic 
								engineering, genetic fingerprinting, and much 
								more (<i><b>50Genetics Ideas</b></i> <i>you 
								really need to know</i>, Mark Henderson, 2008).
								</p>
								<p>The modes of processes and actions of genes 
								and gene pairs are subject to an essentially 
								simple – but in practice quite complex – set of 
								genetic, chemical and mathematical principles 
								and rules. As one basic example of the system, 
								the gene for a particular trait might be <i>
								dominant</i> or <i>recessive</i>, which means 
								that if <i>both </i>genes in a pair are 
								dominant, or even only <i>one</i>, the trait 
								will be manifested, if both are recessive, the 
								trait will not appear in the individual. </p>
								<p>This aspect of biological inheritance is the 
								significant <i>starting point</i> for 
								appreciating in humans, the structures, 
								functions and behaviors of living, breathing 
								active individuals, and so, on averages, those 
								attributed to populations of people. </p>
								<p>However, before the final <i>expression </i>
								of a gene (that is, its manifestation in an 
								individual), it is subject to interaction with 
								the complex series of features to which it is 
								exposed in the course of its conception-to-death 
								environments: internal,­ other genes, chemicals, 
								and external ­ personal, cultural, social and 
								other life experiences. These exposures of a 
								gene or gene pair may result in modifications to 
								its predisposed trait ­ or even to its being 
								turned <i>on</i> or <i>off</i>. </p>
								<p>The environmental influences on different 
								traits vary greatly. As a generalization, in 
								physical (say, eye pigmentation) and 
								physiological (such as, blood groups) traits the 
								genetic basis is generally the determining 
								factor, but in aspects of behaviors, aptitudes 
								and intellect, the environmental encounters may 
								be highly significant. The early imprinting of 
								behaviors, including language, from early 
								family, cultural, economic and physical 
								environment is generally strong.</p>
								<p>When viewing groups of people of all sizes 
								and of the very many different types, the 
								individual differences constitute the population 
								variation. If the aspect is <i>continuous</i>, 
								such as for stature or pigmentation, there is an 
								average (mean value), with the range in the 
								population to various degrees greater or less, 
								forming what is called a <i>normal curve</i>, 
								with progressively less individuals on the 
								‘greater’ and ‘lesser’ sides. For <i>
								discontinuous</i> (present or absent) 
								characteristics, for example for blood groups, 
								there is a range for each of the four types (O, 
								A, B, AB).</font></span></p></td>
