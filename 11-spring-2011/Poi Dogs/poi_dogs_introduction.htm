<meta name="description" content="A group of Maui artists, spearheaded by Darrell Orwig et al, is preparing an exhibition for the Maui Arts and Cultural Center, commenting on issues of origination and belonging. In our island community, layer upon layer of immigration, from the earliest Polynesian settlers, to the migrations of generations of peoples from around the globe has created a multiethnic community in which our sense of belonging has many faces. That sense of belonging people have for one another is described for us in many ways. We are separated and divided by our looks, our behaviors, our beliefs, our geography, and our history. As our world grows smaller and more crowded, competition for resources grows more fierce, and the question of ‘firstness’ arises. Who got here first? Who has a right to claim ownership of land and culture? In earlier times ‘poi dogs’ were a specific breed of dog, selected by native Hawaiians to be fed poi (pounded taro root), and fattened up for eating. At some point, apparently the last true poi dog was eaten and the term Poi Dogs became a colloquial term applied to mixed breed dogs in the islands of Hawaii. Now ‘mixed breed’ humans from all walks of life, in support of Poi Dogs, offer support and perspective on this pervasive issue. ">
