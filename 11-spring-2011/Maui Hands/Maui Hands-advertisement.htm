			About the Artist <br>
			<br>
			Mary Ann Leigh has productively and happily worn many hats in this 
			life and recently had to ask herself the question, “What happens 
			when you get to a point in your life where you can move to Maui to 
			kick back?<br>
			<br>
			Having studied pottery in college, she often thought about finding 
			the time and place to learn more. Aloha, Maui! With all of the art 
			opportunities, wonderful classes, and fantastic teachers available, 
			she thought, how could hard work and dedication not lead to 
			progress? And it did, rapidly and in a big way. You simply have to 
			see these pieces. Mary Ann loves to create the most mind boggling 
			and difficult pieces she can think of. <br>
			<br>
			She says of her work “Creative exploration brings tremendous joy! I 
			see something magical in the world and wonder how to translate the 
			concept into a ceramic work. Inspiration is found in an ocean with 
			attitude, a posturing bird, the curve of a leaf, the flounce of 
			petals, and the precariousness of rock outcrops. Often the struggle 
			to create is just that. The more complicated and quirky the idea, 
			the more gravity defying, the more complex the techniques to be 
			mastered, the more engineering, the more re-engineering, the making 
			of glazes, the re-making of glazes, and especially, the more 
			puzzling the process, the more I delight in the finished product 
			that results when planning, will, luck, determination, and 
			serendipity all come together. When that kiln door is opened, 
			sometimes, and really only sometimes, there is magic.” <br>
			<br>
			Pictured here are two masks. These are an example of the simple 
			construction that Mary Ann will also be demonstrating during the 
			Makawao Christmas Festival on Saturday, December 10th. Come join the 
			fun!</font></td>
