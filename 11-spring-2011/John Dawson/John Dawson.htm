			If you have ever taken a drawing class you know the difficulty; 
			studying the model, following the curve of the thigh and using line 
			to describe form. The realization came quickly that in spite of 
			excellent vision, I could not ‘see’. My friend John Dawson can 
			see. Unlike you or me, John can see far beyond our paltry abilities 
			using uncanny sensory skills that allow millions of us to join him 
			on his visual journey through the natural world. As an artist, he is 
			one of those rare souls who have mastered technique, and can depict 
			nature beyond the real. You are familiar with his work, although you 
			may not know it, because he has illustrated so many magazine 
			articles, ads and U.S. postage stamps that we all have encountered 
			it numerous times. John views the world not as it is, but as it 
			needs to appear in order to enhance our understanding of it. That is 
			vision.</font></span></td>

			One of my first introductions to John’s special skill was a poster 
			he created for Virgin Islands National Park. He was tasked with 
			including all the salient features of the park, both above and 
			beneath the sea in one spectacular vista. The scene was 
			transporting. You were there within the park in a way that no visit 
			would ever place you. This was one of the first in a long series of 
			incredible dioramas John has painted over the years. His ability to 
			create these fantastic scenes eventually led to his <i>Nature of
