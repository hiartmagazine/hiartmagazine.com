				<font SIZE="4">During the past few thousand years of human 
				history, the misconceptions about, and the conflicts between, 
				human groupings – notably after the introduction of the term <i>
				race </i>– have been an ongoing source of discrimination, 
				prejudice, misery and murder. Two of the most infamous, 20<sup>th</sup> 
				Century examples have been the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S.A. (<i>The 
				Clansman</i> by Thomas Dixon, 1905) and Nazism in Germany (<i>Mein 
				Kampf</i> by Adolf Hitler, 1925 – 27). Recently, there has been 
				violent conflict between the Serbs and Croats in Bosnia and 
				Herzegovina, and at present, there is ongoing, bitter battle 
				between the Sunnis and the Shi’ites in the Muslim world.
				<p>What are the biological and cultural bases of human grouping, 
				and what have been the outcomes and implications of their 
				application in humankind?</font></span><span LANG="EN"><font SIZE="4"><p>Looking back first at humankind’s biological history, one finds 
				that in many animal groups today, there are species which are 
				genetically programmed to live in groups, and these include most 
				monkeys and great apes, such as the chimpanzees, our closest 
				living relatives. It is probably from a shared, ancestral group 
				with the chimpanzees, that humans inherited their group-forming 
				behavior.
				</p>
				<p>The initial human grouping was most likely the basic family 
				of a male and one or more females. However, for protecting 
				feeding grounds and a source of water, it was soon, widened – as 
				in chimpanzees – to include close relatives, to form what in 
				humans is termed, a kinship group. Over time, such groupings 
				were progressively extended into tribal, next regional and then 
				national groups. Within such groups, a great variety of 
				sub-groupings were created, such as: religious, social, trade or 
				profession; and, relatively recently, down to even football team 
				supporter, groups.</font></span></td>

								Initially, groups were physically isolated or 
				behaviorally separated, by features such as: competition for 
				territory, great distance, physical barriers, unfamiliarity with 
				local adaptations in behavior and culture. In more recent times, 
				group identification and inter-group competition, became based 
				on differences in political, social and belief systems, and a 
				few physical features – population variations. In addition, 
				group conflict might also result, as earlier, from the desire 
				for more territory or resources, differences in views and 
				opinions – and even just plain envy! The various human groupings 
				came to involve strong group loyalties, through common 
				interests, beliefs and other concepts, and these led to binding
				<i>co-operation within</i> groups, but also to various levels of
				<i>competition</i> <i>between</i> groups.
				<p>Many groups in the earlier years of human history, and 
				others, culturally isolated from the more developed societies 
				until relatively recently, developed mythologies to account for 
				their group’s origin. The Australian Aboriginal people believe 
				that it was in their mythological <i>Dreamtime</i>, that they 
				came into existence from <i>Ancestral Beings</i>, and the 
				Khoi-Khoi (‘Hottentots’) in southern Africa say that their 
				ancestral father was the deity, Tsui - // goab [the ‘-<b>’</b> 
				and the ‘<b>//’</b> are two of the click sounds that are basic 
				parts of their language]. The ancient Maya of South America 
				believed that the creation of humankind occurred with the 
				opening of the <i>Maize</i> (<i>Sustenance</i>) <i>Mountain</i>. 
				According to the <i>Old Testament</i>, some 5771 years ago 
				(following the Jewish calendar) man and then woman were created

				There is a vast collection of literature on ‘race’, considering the 
definitions of the postulated groups, and specifying their characteristics. I 
briefly describe below just a few salutary examples, mainly from books, such as:
<i>The Races of Europe</i> (1899) by WZ Ripley; ‘The Races in Europe’ (in: <i>On 
Living in a Revolution</i>) by Julian Huxley (1946); <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i> 
(1981) by Stephen Jay Gould; and <i>The Race Gallery </i>(1995) by Marek Kohn.<p>It was in Europe after the Renaissance, that for some of the geographically 
separated, or the physical, cultural or political differences between groups, 
that the term, <i>race</i>, was introduced (Julian Huxley, 1946, <i>On Living in 
a Revolution</i>, p. 163). What, then, is the meaning (biologically and 
culturally) of the term, <i>race</i>, and what are the implications for human 
groupings of those different interpretations and applications?</p>
				<p>Other than ‘races’ being defined by language or religion, many 
anthropologists have used a diverse number of parameters to define populations 
in humankind. As people from Europe explored the then unknown world of Africa 
and the East, skin pigmentation was one of the first commonly used features. The 
subdivisions of skin color defined were: white, yellow, brown, red or black. 
Other features, early introduced for human population subdivisions, included: 
skull (cranium and face) measurements, nose shape, eye color and shape, hair 
texture, body size and proportions, and even behavioral and cultural features.
				</p>
<p>As a point of historic interest in defining humankind as ‘species and their 
subgroups’, behavioral and cultural features were included in the classification 
of Carolus Linnaeus (1707 – 1778), whose hierarchical system of group naming 
(taxonomy: species, genus, family, class, phylum) is basically still used today. 
Linnaeus classified humankind as including two species: the first, <i>H. sapien</i>s, 
varied by education (culture) and situation (geography); the second species, <i>
H. monstrosus</i>, varied by climate or art, the latter term meaning manner or 
behavior. Further, within <i>Homo sapiens</i> he included 5 varieties: Europeans 
– sanguine, gentle, acute, inventive – governed by laws; Africans – phlegmatic, 
relaxed, crafty, indolent, negligent governed by caprice (whims). The second 
species <i>H. monstrosus</i> included six varieties, e.g. Patagonians – large 
indolent, and Hottentots – one testis, less fertile (pp. 283 – 4). [Linnaeus’ 
source for ‘Hottentots’ having one testis is not known, but it is quite 
incorrect!]<br>

							In 1853, Friedrich Max Müller, an eminent philologist and philosopher, 
introduced the term ‘Aryan’, as a <i>linguistic</i> group, and also<i> a ‘race’</i>. 
The idea of its being a ‘race’ was criticized at the time quite severely by some 
– and later, more widely, including by Müller himself! (in: Huxley, p. 173). 
Also, with regard to ‘behavioral and cultural’ being included in biological race 
classifications, in 1899, Ripley clearly stated (on page 1 of his book), that: 
“Race, properly speaking, is responsible only for those peculiarities, mental or 
bodily, which are transmitted with constancy along the lines of direct physical 
descent from father to son.”.</font></span></td>

							Despite the wide rejection of the concept of a ‘race’ called ‘Aryans’, some 
Germans – notably the Nazis – later claimed those mythical people to have 
existed, and been: tall, fair and long-headed, and the ancestors of another 
hypothetical race, the ‘Teutons’. These proposals were just two of the many, 
similar, invalid ‘racial’ groups, such as ‘Caucasoid’, ‘Mongoloid’ and 
‘Negroid’, postulated during a very complex period (1850–1950) of so-called 
‘racial history’. One prominent contributor, who expanded and compounded these 
ideas during that time, was the French, Count Joseph de Gobineau (1816 – 1882); 
he added to the list by introducing ‘races’, such as a ‘Nordic race’. <br>
							<br>
							Huxley (p. 171) provides a clever parody on these 19<sup>th</sup> – 20<sup>th</sup> 
Century, false ideas of ‘races and lineages’, as exemplified by the 1939 – 1945, 
German, Nazi hierarchy. Huxley writes: “Thus our German neighbors have ascribed 
to themselves a Teutonic type that is fair, long-headed, tall, slender, 
unemotional, brave straightforward, gentle, and virile. Let us make a composite 
picture of a typical Teuton from the most prominent of the exponents of this 
view. Let him be physically as blond and mentally as unemotional as Hitler, 
physically as long-headed and mentally as direct as Rosenberg, as tall and 
truthful as Goebbels, as slender and gentle as Goering, and as manly and 
straightforward as Streicher.” Those familiar with the Nazi period in Germany 
will appreciate [the sarcasm] of the directly opposite features to those listed, 
as characterizing the leading figures in the Nazi hierarchy.</font></span></td>
