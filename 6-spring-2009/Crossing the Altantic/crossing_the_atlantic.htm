		The quasi-religious status of classical Western art in Europe is a 
		reflection of the literal power of religious and cultural institutions 
		developed through centuries. All the places of cultural worship – 
		museums, concert halls, conservatories and art academies share in this 
		reality. That is why in Europe (as well as other areas of strong 
		historical cultural influence, such as Asia or the Middle-East) there 
		are no real dilemmas concerning traditional arts in general; the 
		immutability of their theory and practice is something that requires 
		obedience and an absolute faith.<br>
		<br>
		In the United States, the perception and praxis of traditional Western 
		art are much more ambiguous and complicated. There, it remains a distant 
		memory of the glory of the elect and powerful, but since there has been 
		a wide breach with the European tradition, it has been invested with an 
		extra value; it is a symbol of education and social prestige (les 
		nouveaux riches of the New World)[1]. As in Japan (a country that had an 
		indirect way of absorbing European culture), classical Western art is 
		strongly perceived as a symbol, since it is imported and lacks its 
		contextual historical dimension.<br>
		<br>
		After having spent twenty-five years in the U.S., it looks to this 
		writer, that the linear concept of cultural progress and evolution is 
		still &quot;alive and well&quot; in Europe, while it has almost disappeared on the 
		American cultural horizon. Contemporary classical music, for example, 
		follows the same idea of cultural progress inherited from the 
		enlightenment, (more complex or more scientific is better etc.) that has 
		been in action for centuries. Spectral music- the &quot;last word in musical 
		progress&quot;, finds its security and value in scientific, therefore 
		verifiable spirit.<font size="2"><br>

		Americans are infatuated with every new technology, it is always a 
		statistical, pragmatic reality that is the measure of value.[2] 
		Therefore, it does not really matter if something is historically based, 
		conceptualized, or whatever ethnic or cultural origins it has – as long 
		as it sells, its virtues are extolled[3]. In Europe, in order to prove 
		your worth, first you have to twist yourself into a cultural pretzel and 
		prove your compliance to the established (culturally inherited) 
		aesthetic postulates. Not so in America. There, first you have to be 
		successful, then you can be valued; in Europe, first you have to be 
		valued, then you can be successful.[4]<br>
		<br>
		The influence of religion on any culture is self-evident. If European 
		traditional Western art shows close dependence on Christianity, so do 
		the Asian cultures in their adherence to Buddhism and Confucianism. 
		European and Asian concern with formal coherence and unity seem just 
		like another reflection of their respective religious and social order. 
		America, by contrast, because of its coexistence of many different sects 
		and ethnicities, does not rely on cultural idealism in a monotheistic 
		fashion: it is rather an eclectic mishmash more resembling polytheism 
		than any other belief system.<br>

		Even if American commercialism – like a cultural hydra – sprouts a new 
		head with every cultural mutation, the idea of creating a new 
		revolutionary set of postulates needs a space and a time, literal and 
		conceptual. In Europe creating new, revolutionary movements tends to be 
		blocked and paralyzed by the power of cultural institutions; in America, 
		it is paralyzed by the overwhelming presence of commercial channels and 
		routes. In Europe, cultural revolutions happen despite institutions, in 
		America, despite the lack of them. [6]<br>
		<br>
		An interesting situation is that of cross-cultural and transcontinental 
		artists. Here is a letter of Marcel Duchamp to Hans Richter, from which 
		we can clearly see the confrontation of the European and the American 
		way of handling art. &quot;This neo-dada&quot;, he wrote in 1962,&quot;which now calls 
		itself new realism, Pop-Art, assemblage, etc. is a cheap distraction 
		which lives off what Dada did. When I discovered ready-made, I was 
		hoping to discourage this aesthetic carnival. But neo-dadaists use 
		ready-made to discover an aesthetic value. I threw the bottle rack and 
		the urinal on their heads as a provocation, and here they are admiring 
		its beauty...&quot;[7] If irony can sell, it becomes yet another valuable 
		object of commercial consumption.<br>
		<br>
		While the distinctions of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; art remain categories upon 
		which to judge the value of an art work in Europe, it seems obsolete or 
		dated in the U.S. Jazz, Rock, Classical, Pop and other terms refer to 
		individual orientations, marketing preferences or stylistic constraints. 
		This is partially due to the statistical nature of systems of value (as 
		explained above) and partially to the typically egalitarian way of 
		handling aesthetic categories in America. Since &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; art are 
		no more than sociological terms, the art world has been made egalitarian 
		and fully relative.</font></td>

		Even though academia remains precariously safe in its ivory tower in 
		Europe, the powerful undercurrents of postmodern cultural egalitarianism 
		threaten to dissolve its foundations. In reality, authentic 
		inauthentic California-style &quot;cool Stalinism&quot;[8] shows up in most 
		countries of the European community, but in its second-hand version. The 
		most extraordinary incarnations show up in unlikely places; a uniquely 
		European invention – a coffee shop – which has been parodied in a 
		uniquely American way (decaf-double-latte), reappears as Starbucks in 
		downtown Geneva. What the enlightened 60s and 70s created in the U.S. is 
		quite visible and apparent in its &quot;soft&quot; version all across the European 
		continent.<br>
		<br>
		As opposed to the cultural egalitarianism of the U.S., the new European 
		version seems somehow self-conscious and artificial. As a person who, by 
		accident and design, belongs to both camps, I am struck by how deep 
		prejudices are on both sides. It is still very un- (mid-) American to be 
		intellectual, just as it is very un- (West-) European to &quot;just do it&quot;. 
		Nevertheless, the opposites do meet with an underlying sort of nostalgia 
		and longing that can be seen beneath the cultural veneer. We might well 
		be witnessing the aftereffects of European cultural middle age 
		infatuation with American cultural teenage vitality and vice versa.</font></td>
