							<br>
							For the almost thirty years I have known Michael 
							Frimkess he has tried to mold me as a disciple, 
							almost as much as he works on forming his wheel-thrown vessels. In fact, from the first time I met Frimkess, he began working on me to join his nearly 
							religious quest to achieve nirvana through various 
							attempts at taming the world through esoteric 
							disciplines.<br>
							<p>He waxed poetic about exotic skill sets ranging 
							from meditation to Chinese martial arts practices 
							and classical western music theory. Crowning all 
							these ideologies was his fervent belief in the 
							significance of certain wheel-thrown ceramic vessel 
							forming techniques, which he claims were handed down 
							through history directly to him from the ancient 
							Greeks, via a pottery factory in Western 
							Pennsylvania.<br>

							God, Frimkess has embarked on a second quest for a

							build the gas-fired kiln analog of a 100 mile per

							<p class="MsoNormal">What does all this have to do with the perfection 
							of imperfectability?<br>
							</p>
							<p>Consider the alluring beauty of Platonic forms: 
							Perfect triangles and golden rectangles glisten in 
							the mind’s eye as we meditate on the concept of an 
							ideal circle. But when we look around us, we witness 
							that chaos reigns in a universe dominated by 
							entropy. No wonder people spend lifetimes out in the 
							barn trying to build perpetual motion machines out 
							of spare bicycle and lawnmower parts. If we just try 
							hard enough we might achieve an imagined perfection! 
							It turns out the world is full of wondrous 
							inspiration but short on frictionless movement.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Returning to Michael Frimkess’ influences – We 
							witness an overarching striving for an elusive 
							sense of a global perfection. Renaissance 
							artists–inspired by the Greeks–could be sculptors, 
							painters, architects and scientists, who might even 
							work their way through medical school as ceiling 
							muralists! Da Vinci inspired generations with a 
							grasp of many art forms and an ability to render 
							impressions of the world in startling realism via an 
							understanding of perspective, optics and expert 
							craftsmanship. The sciences evolved also, producing 
							great minds like Euclid and Newton, yielding a 
							worldview of a perfectly operating universe 
							analogous to giant cosmic clock.<br>
							<br>
							But the clocklike perfection and harmony of the 
							spheres view changed with the “modern” era. Einstein 
							sent Newton on a time travel ship. Picasso and 
							Pollack took art from exquisite renderings and multi 
							point perspective to cartoon nudes with multi-nosed 
							faces, and paint applied by drip and splash. <br>
							</p>
							<p>And pottery at Otis Art Center in Los Angeles in 
							the 1950’s evolved from the teapot and casserole 
							dish, to an infinitely changeable canvass for 
							creativity with no rules for form and no need for 
							function: In 1956, student Michael Frimkess had a 
							vision that set him on the road to a personal art 
							renaissance. He was partly inspired (like those 
							Renaissance artists) by the Greeks as people. But in 
							Frimkess’ case the main fascination was with Greek 
							pottery.</p>

							Between his own cultural roots as a young Jewish 
							artist, and the influences of the ethnic melting pot 
							of Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, which was 
							rapidly changing from a Jewish enclave to a Latino 
							and African American population, Frimkess was 
							uniquely positioned for a fresh perspective on 
							classicism. Social consciousness, ethnic diversity, 
							and jazz music, found Frimkess at the epicenter of a 
							revolutionary movement where abstract expressionism 
							met studio ceramics, all by the time he was 17. 
							Between psychedelic drugs, bebop music and the World 
							War II gunnery veterans piling giant wet clay 
							vessels on top of each other as artwork, there were 
							influences at play, with which Michelangelo and 
							Raphael never contended.</font></span></td>

							<p>In contrast, Frimkess is completely obsessed with 
							the process of the artist/craftsman’s discipline. He 
							is a unique pioneer evolving in the milieu of 
							abstract expressionism, in that he was not focused 
							on the emotive gesture. Frimkess combined a 
							renaissance-like inclusiveness of multiple fields of 
							endeavor with a pop inspired eye for contemporary 
							culture, and an eccentric sense of humor, 
							integrating all these elements vertically into a 
							cohesive world view, lifestyle and artistic pursuit.<img border="0" src="pot-3.jpg" width="327" height="360" align="right"><br>
							</p>
							<p>Imagine a politically progressive, multi-media 
							public access website with Wikipedia links at every 
							juncture. Frimkess as “programming” director wants 
							to encompasses everything from ecology to racial 
							inclusiveness and provide equal opportunity for 
							Greek Classicism and California funk. His pod casts 
							might expound on the common musical theory basis of 
							Bach and Charlie Parker. His commentaries are 
							out-of-left-field notions of a better world. And 
							whatever his personal foibles, Frimkess strives to 
							make a contribution to society via his efforts.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Returning to ‘the perfection of the imperfectible’, 
							Frimkess loves to talk about the Western musical 
							scale and theory which we all take so for granted. 
							Western music theory is a thing of mathematical 
							beauty, the basis of chordal harmonies and the 
							foundation for a 100-piece orchestra, playing in 
							synchrony. All this, an artifice which is no more 
							“perfect” than a 50 cent kazoo, though far more 
							complicated and elaborate. For without some artistic 
							wiggle room, the Western musical scale is not nearly 
							as good as it sounds on paper. The “well tempered” 
							scale is superior to a thing of mathematical 
							perfection, only when it reaches human ears. And the 
							beauty of jazz and blues music is invoked through 
							the breaking of those sacred rules – the ‘bending’ 
							of notes of the scale is one way musicians achieve a 
							soulful sound.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Newtonian physics once posited the universe as a 
							giant clock, but ideas of transcendental Platonic 
							perfection are sooner or later dispelled.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Nowhere does the importance of imperfection play 
							a more important role than in Frimkess’ best work. 
							The seemingly exquisite Greek vase, upon further 
							inspection is not so perfect after all. The famously 
							thin walls that Frimkess stretches out of clay have 
							tiny holes where chunks of irregularly sized grog 
							tear through the surface. The hospital white glaze 
							is not so even, and the cartoon like imagery doesn’t 
							have the fluid elegance and hair thin lines of 
							ancient Greek pottery. Instead, up close we see 
							irregular wobbly edges and mottled solid colored 
							areas of China paint. There is a slight seismic 
							tremor passing though all of Frimkess' lines: The 
							heart beat of the soul? The funky echoes of mid 1950 
							sessions in the studio with Peter Voulkos? Or is it 
							just the no-longer-steady hand of an artist that has 
							suffered 40 years with multiple sclerosis?<br>
							</p>
							<p>In Frimkess' case the pursuit of the imperfection 
							of the ‘would-be perfect’ knows no bounds. In 
							everything he does Frimkess struggles for Platonic 
							golden nirvana. But as he moves his crippled legs in 
							his unique and daily practice of tai chi; as he 
							tumbles up and down the keyboard of his piano, 
							literally wearing the black keys away under his 
							fingertips; as he arpeggios variations of patterns 
							in every key of the chromatic scale; as he spins his 
							vision of the Greek amphora, and fires his specially 
							designed kilns, nothing is more poetic than the 
							resulting complete lack of perfection in all these 
							perfect pursuits.<br>
