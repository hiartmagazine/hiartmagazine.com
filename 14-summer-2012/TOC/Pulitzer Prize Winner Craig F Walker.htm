							A few weeks ago, logging onto Facebook, I was 
							confronted by an onslaught of congratulatory 
							messages directed toward an old High School friend, 
							Craig Walker. Apparently, he had just been awarded 
							his second (yes SECOND) Pulitzer Prize for feature 
							photography in three years - and all this on top of 
							a slew of other awards including a first place 
							Picture Of The Year International award a few weeks 
							earlier. <br>
							<br>
							It is somewhat difficult to absorb the scope of that 
							kind of professional and artistic achievement from 
							someone who you “knew when…”, but thinking back a 
							few months to when I first saw Craig’s winning photo 
							essay it was not surprising to me that this powerful 
							work should receive such an honor. <br>

							and alternately to gain insight into their psyches. 
							Beautiful images sooth and uplift us, but it takes a 
							certain fearlessness to create and offer for public 
							viewing representations of the darker aspects of our 
							nature. We’ve all seen works that “look like art”; 
							the appropriate elements are all there and they may 
							please us, but we can pause, take them in and 
							continue on our way, unmoved. Whether shooting 
							behind the scenes of an event by Help-Portrait, an 
							organization that offers free portraits to 
							underprivileged families, or capturing the crowning 
							of a local homecoming king, Craig demonstrates his 
							ability to recognize the “moments between” when the 
							subject’s true humanity shines through. The cover 
							photo of “Welcome Home” captures Scott Ostrum in the 
							midst of a full-fledged panic attack and is 
							reminiscent of Edvard Munch’s “The Scream”, a 
							disturbing and enduring image that has prompted 
							endless analysis to the point of becoming a modern 
							pop icon. </font></span></td>
