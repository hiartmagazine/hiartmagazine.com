			<p align="justify"><font size="4">In my first year of college I was 
			introduced to the <i>Meditations</i> of 17<sup>th</sup> century 
			French philosopher, Rene Decartes, beginning famously with the 
			over-coined proposition, “Cogito ergo sum”, <i>I think therefore I 
			am</i>. This was the paradigm underpinning modern Western 
			philosophy, upon which I built my kingdom of certainty.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Following two years of “pure 
			reason”–my newfound faith predictably upon the precipice of 
			collapse–I assailed my professor, “Shouldn’t it read, ‘I think 
			therefore I <i>think </i>I am,’?” Forbidden by this pillar of 
			academia from asking further questions, my passion for logic 
			flagged. The supposition that additive reasoning would create 
			increased certainty, delivering me from the vagaries of 
			emotional relativity into the comforting hands of self-knowledge, 
			disintegrated. I left University that year, and never returned.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">A decade later, transfigured into 
			a pragmatic professional artist, I was confronted with another 
			foundational challenge, this time to that pragmatism, the vestigial 
			tail of my youthful search for certainty. The messenger was an 
			unlikely conceptual artist, Jeannie Cartabiano, whose disturbing 
			works promised meaning but evaded analysis. Struggling to grasp her 
			equivocal constructions, I asked about the essential structures 
			which underpinned her art.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Cartabiano proposed that there 
			really were no such absolutes in existence–only the &quot;certainty&quot; of 
			ambiguity–stories to which we assign certainty for the purpose of 
			getting from A to B. After all, haven't we all been abandoned by our 
			mothers in one form or another? Healthy individuation requires it. 
			How we subsequently begin to re-construct reality depends upon 
			primal human tools; the individual's ability to imagine and believe, 
			built upon a foundation of collective memory, iconicized in art.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“Well, <i>of course</i> there are 
			absolutes!” I blustered. “We all agree the sky is blue! It’s as 
			close to absolute as it gets: It’s a consensual reality.” The world 
			is full of such relative absolutes. ‘Screw the pursuit of pure 
			reason!’ I thought. Descartes was dead to me. This was <i>my</i> 
			functional truth, privately established to keep the beast of 
			uncertainty at bay.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">She replied by deftly raising one 
			eyebrow, a withering dismissive I have always wished to master. And 
			then my counterpart pointed to the screen on the window. “What is 
			it?” she demanded.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“A fly screen,” I replied, just a 
			little miffed by this banal turn of a conversation I’d hoped might 
			become profound.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">“It’s a grid. It’s a divider. It’s 
			a weaving. It’s a …”</font></p>
			</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
			<p align="justify">As she continued, her voice echoed in the 
			distance and the hair stood up on the back of my neck. I felt dizzy. 
			My world view was crumbling. The idea of ‘fly screen’ convulsed and 
			separated from my intentions. She was right! None of this around me 
			was named due to its nature. I had named my reality based on 
			personal attributed assumptions. Those presumptions could change as 
			freely as context and my needs. My confidence in my relationship with reality 
			teetered and toppled. I fell through the floor; the next floor below 
			gave way, and the next, and the next. I descended into the rabbit 
			hole–a chaos of uncertainty.</p>

			I had built my vocabulary for deductive thought in the same way I 
			had built my beliefs about the world–as a systematic additive 
			construct, but if the building blocks were less than absolute, then 
			what of my solid foundational ideas? I began to question my 
			assumptions. Instead creating certainties toward a predestined 
			consensus, I had conflated a highly personal collection of models 
			affixed to my own volatile point of view. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Over ensuing years, the remnants 
			of my attachment to deductive reason dissolved. In my ongoing search 
			for a fulcrum for managing my increasingly human condition, I 
			attached myself to the field of evolutionary biology. If there was 
			certainty to be found in the world, then surely it would be founded 
			upon human experience. What better place to search for human nature 
			than in the nature of humans?&#12288;</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Principles emerged: Human 
			perception, behavior, and yes, even art-making, all reflected the 
			paradigms which had once emerged from our differential survival. 
			Aesthetics became the language of my atheist soul: Art–not as formal 
			object–but as a state of mind, became the most mystifyingly 
			impractical and yet fundamental of all human expressions. The 
			economy of natural selection endows human regularities (those 
			singular things we all do in culturally distinct forms) with 
			survival value, so art might explain itself in a measurable economic 
			way.&#12288;</font></p>
			</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
			</font><font FACE="Arial">
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Daunted by the task of finding 
			those commonalities, I once again approached my conceptualist friend 
			and asked: “Could you reduce one of your compositions down to simple 
			language for me?” I was asking her what those magical icons might be 
			which<i> preceded</i> the making of profound art. Were there 
			archetypal patterns?&#12288;&#12288;</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">But there was that raised eyebrow 
			again–that withering look which suggested I’d just crawled out from 
			beneath a rock: “My compositions <i>are</i> simple language,” she 
			replied. “Art can’t be reduced.”&#12288;&#12288;</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Once again decades of assumptions 
			collapsed. I had always believed that thought lay at the foundation 
			of my human nature. Now it was clear: We might describe art through 
			our language, but art is a fundamental, functional expression of our 
			humanness. A description of art could never be more than just what 
			we <i>think</i> of our humanness.&#12288;</font></p>

			</font><font face="Arial"><font size="4">How many times had I seen 
			an artist create a profound work, but when asked about its meaning, 
			offer a trite, contrived response that did little but undermine the 
			profundity of the work itself? There is so often a gap between 
			conscious intention and the driving principle of effective art; a 
			gap which is only bridged by the art itself. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">‘We don’t know what we’re doing!’ 
			I suddenly thought. But more accurately, ‘<i>I</i> don’t know what
			<i>I’m</i> doing.’ </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">From Diogenes, who carried his 
			lamp through the daylight streets of Athens seeking an honest man, 
			to Duchamp’s urinal as “Fountain”, conceptual artists have disrupted 
			the cultural perception of art as commodity, redefining idea, melded 
			as both the subject of art, and as its object.&#12288;</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Drawing no divide between that 
			which is known intellectually and that which emerges from the 
			viscera, conceptual art attempts to seamlessly embrace the entire 
			edifice which is our being, so that we might experience and express 
			our humanness in an integration of the voices of reason, passion, 
			and intuition. Not from rational patterns of thought, system or 
			reason, but from the absence of pattern or the appearance of the 
			rational, we continue to navigate within that vast inconstancy which
