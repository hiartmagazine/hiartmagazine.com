							were overwhelming him and these were the moments 
							that he wanted to document, not just the relatively

							Ostrom counts the stitches in his wrist while having 
							a drink at a bar in Boulder after his suicide 
							attempt. Scott said many times he should have died 
							overseas, and during the fight with his girlfriend, 
							she agreed. &quot;I just grabbed a pair of scissors. ... 
							I just tried jabbing them into my neck, but they 
							were closed, so I just gave myself a nice 
							laceration. So, I grabbed a 
							kitchen knife and cut my wrists,&quot; Scott said.</font></i><br>
