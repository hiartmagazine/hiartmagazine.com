		Perhaps it was 
		inevitable that they be together - two people, born in the East, 
		strongly influenced by the West, raised and trained on opposite sides of 
		the Pacific, who found their essence, and each other, in a mutual 
		obsession with art. <br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="beauty-and-voice-of-nature-.jpg" width="576" height="214" align="right">Susumu Sakaguchi’s mother was Nisei, second generation 
		American-Japanese, born in Greeley, Colorado. As a child, her 
		grandfather took her to Japan for her education, where they got caught 
		in the middle of a war. She married there, but by 1956, with Japan still 
		in poor condition, she brought her family to the United States. Susumu 
		was twelve and already showing talent as a painter. He entered Otis 
		Institute of Arts in Los Angeles at age 14.</font></div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font color="#C0B385">
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="shizuno-1-web.jpg" width="216" height="273" align="left">Shizuno 
		Nasu suffered a terrible burn on her left arm when she was three. She 
		still bears the scars. As part of her rehabilitation, she was sent by 
		her parents, at that tender age, to learn ballet. At seven, she was 
		selected to study with The Bolshoi, who sent a Russian teacher to Japan 
		to give classes to invitees. Under his tutelage, she knew she’d be a 
		dancer for life.<br>
		<br>
		Susumu earned his Master’s degree at the California Institute of Art, 
		taught by video artist Nam Jun Paik; conceptual artist John Baldessari; 
		performance artist Allen Kaprow,; and “my personal mentor,” Mariam 
		Shapiro, “a leading feminist who started the movement with Judy Chicago 
		and Kate Millet.” He moved to New York City in 1973 and was assistant to 
		Isamu Noguchi from 1977 to 1988. Noguchi was 74 and he was 34 when they 
		began their long association.<br>
		<br>
		Shizuno, meanwhile, entered Osaka Institute of Art, studying ballet, 
		tap, jazz, “so many Western techniques.” After graduation, she opened 
		her first, tiny, dance studio with seven students. By age 35, she had 
		three studios and 100 students, but no time to explore her personal 
		questions, “Why dance?” and “Dance where?”<br>
		</font><br>
		<font color="#C0B385">She closed her studios, and with her small 
		daughter, moved to a remote village “almost a ghost-town” in the 
		mountains of Niigata, Northern Japan, renting a three hundred year old 
		house with a floor so rickety she had to repair it herself before it was 
		fit to dance on. To buy groceries she walked 6 miles, there and back. 
		And she danced, alone, on a rigid schedule she set for herself, every 
		day, through the stifling heat of summer and the deep snows of winter, 
		creating and re-creating her art.<br>
		<br>
		Susumu 
		had his own self-imposed schedule, painting every day. “Splashing 
		paint,” he says, “I come to the same place Shizuno talks about, ‘No 
		mind.” From 1972 onward, he showed his paintings in galleries and 
		museums all over the United States and Japan. His resume reads: New 
		York, New York, Tokyo, Tokyo, Philadelphia, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Jersey 
		City.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="Reaity-&-Essence.jpg" width="575" height="183" align="left"><br>
		His work was equally influenced by nature and what is man-made. In New 
		York, “concept” was the main story, but for him, it couldn't be 
		everything. “My 
		knowledge is American, but my sensibility is still Japanese. It looks 
		like I cannot change,” he laughs.<br>
		<br>
		Shizuno wanted to go to Bali, but instead an opportunity came to dance 
		in Paris. “Paree? Not Bali? The gods misunderstood!,” she complains.<br>
		<br>
		In France she performed at the Japanese Embassy and UNESCO Hall, 
		exhibiting her self-created, very personal dance form. But the art 
		director told her, “Your dance is not unique. Your spirit is Japanese 
		but your techniques are all Western. Your body isn’t expressing what you 
		want it to. I’d like to see you dance what can only be danced by someone 
		Japanese.”<br>
		<br>
		In those years, Susumu, as Isamu Noguchi’s assistant, was attending the 
		glittering major museum shows of his elderly employer and friend, 
		meeting other legends of American art, also very elderly: Louise 
		Nevelson in her nineties, Georgia O’Keefe in her eighties.<br>
		At a Noguchi retrospective at the Whitney Museum, he met the diminutive, 
		still beautiful, pioneer of modem dance, Martha Graham, who arrived in a 
		full length mink coat which grazed the floor. “She was like a fantasy. 
		Magatama!” he says, using a Japanese word which describes a jewel, a 
		symbol of the source of life.<img border="0" src="shizuno-2-web.jpg" width="213" height="288" align="right"><br>
		<br>
		Shizuno Nasu had never studied Japanese dance. The form she now decided 
		to explore was never danced by a woman. This was the primitive, 
		mythological, story-telling dance of the Shinto priests, known as “kagura.” 
		She travelled, with her small daughter, to one of the oldest Shinto 
		shrines, Takachiho Temple, near Aso Volcano and volunteered to clean up. 
		When someone finally asked,
		“What are you doing here, always cleaning?” she revealed that she wanted 
		to study the secret, sacred dance. The head priest of the temple taught 
		her how to study: not to ask for anything, just to dance with devotion. 
		Thus prepared, he took her to a teacher who would introduce her to the 
		mysteries of kagura. After her training in this exacting form of dance, 
		she practiced her art in Shinto and Buddhist temples throughout Japan 
		for eight years. Arriving invited or uninvited, her child in tow, she 
		danced with pure devotion.<br>
		“Sometimes they gave you a little food,” she says.<br>
		<br>
		Susumu Sakaguchi was coming into his own as a painter. Exhibition 
		followed exhibition. One was a group show at the Fukuyama City Museum in 
		Hiroshima, featuring twelve New York artists. Shizuno attended  
		the exhibition and left a note for Susumu, saying that, of all the work, 
		only his paintings spoke to her. “I had to stop and listen,” she wrote, 
		and, “I’d like to see more of your art.” Her letter, left at the museum, 
		ended up in his jacket pocket. He didn’t have time to read it 
		immediately, then forgot it was there.<br></p>
		<p align="left">Six months later, at a solo show in Okayama, Japan, he wore the same 
		jacket, put his hand in his pocket, and found her note. The gallery 
		manager contacted Shizuno, who just happened to live nearby. She came to 
		the gallery and was introduced to Susumu.<br>
		<br>
		In Okayama, Susumu hung a six foot by twenty-four foot painting. Shizuno, 
		who was starring in a half-hour television special, asked if she could 
		shoot at the gallery, and “dance with your painting.” He agreed.<br></p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="susumu-shizuno-web.jpg" width="575" height="237"><br>
		</p>
		</p>
		<p>During the next few months, he began to go and see her perform. When his 
		gallery gave him a studio to work in for the summer in Ushimado, a 
		beautiful fishing village two hours from Shizuno’s house, she and her 
		daughter spent time with him there “just enjoying.” Before returning to 
		New York, he invited them both to follow him. He gave them two one way 
		tickets.<br>
		<br>
		In 1997, Susumu and Shizuno were married at the gallery where they first 
		met in Okayama. He had an exhibition, she danced, and they said “I do,” 
		in front of another of his twenty-four foot paintings.<br>
		<br>
		Since then, they’ve lived a tri-coastal existence, commuting between New 
		York, Japan and the Big Island of Hawaii, exhibiting their art 
		internationally. In downtown Manhatten, his 3,000 square foot studio is 
		a 15 minute walk away from 9/11’s ground zero. There, their environment, 
		though obviously fragile, is completely man-made. Here in Hawaii, 
		they’re surrounded by nature and live on an active volcano.<br>
		<br>
		“In Hawaii, nature gives you a guide to a different way to live,” Susumu 
		says, “not so conceptual. You really feel that nature is most important 
		and that, here, you can find a balance.”<br>
		<br>
		In the near future, Susumu Sakaguchi and Shizuno Nasu will base 
		themselves permanently in Hawaii. He’ll still be painting every possible 
		moment of every day. She’ll still be dancing to the music of a stone 
		flute or a jazz saxaphone, in front of an audience, or alone, in full 
		costume, with the wind for accompaniment, on Kilauea volcano. They may 
		alter their style of living but they’ll never change their mutual 
		support of each others’ work. They’ll never change their romance with 
		art.</p>
