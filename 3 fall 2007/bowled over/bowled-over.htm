		One of the very first collectible items I bought in Hawaii was a lidded 
		box made by an anonymous island artisan. Four decades later it’s still 
		holding a few pieces of jewelry but is now the beginning footnote to my 
		ever growing collection of wood art – the majority of which are vessels 
		that were fashioned right here in the islands.<br>
		<br>
		Let me digress to add that my fascination with turned bowls really stems 
		from meeting Bob Stocksdale (and his equally talented fiber artist wife 
		– Kay Sekimachi) at their Berkeley studio/home in the mid70’s. To watch 
		Bob turning was an eye-opening experience culminating in my purchasing 
		two memorable pieces. As years passed and our friendship deepened, I 
		added several more of his exquisite bowls to an ever-expanding 
		collection. At last count I owned nearly a century mark total created by 
		a dozen turners.<br>
		<img border="0" src="stockdale-edit.jpg" width="504" height="197" align="right"><br>
		Bob, who died in 2003, was called the “Grandfather of the contemporary 
		American wood bowl.” His dedication to and his expertise in that art 
		were demonstrated time and again via bowls whose beauty quite simply 
		took your breathe away. Awe-inspiring with unexpected bone-China 
		thinness, you automatically marveled at his naturally edged rims. His 
		stunning discovery and then exposure of both grain and coloration 
		continually fascinate even the most jaded collectors while the seemingly 
		infinite variety in types of wood used and his varied signature styles 
		were nothing short of amazing. Bob pioneered much of what today’s wood 
		turners take for granted. He also freely shared those newly discovered 
		techniques with anyone and everyone and for his generosity and artistry 
		was awarded the American Crafts Council Gold Medal for Craftsmanship in 
		1995. It would do many island wood turners good to study the enormous 
		effect this gentle man had on their shared craft and to learn a thing or 
		two about that art from a true master!<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="renee-ben-edit-2-sm.jpg" width="273" height="216" align="left">But indeed many of the finest bowl makers in our islands have taken more 
		than a page or two from the Stocksdale lesson book. One I can easily 
		point to is Renée Fukumoto Ben whose fascination with turning 
		came in a round-about way after having created work in a variety of 
		crafts &amp; the arts. 
		<img border="0" src="renee-ben-edit-sm.jpg" width="302" height="216" align="right">It was through her wood-worker husband, Gerald, she 
		came to bowl turning, but serendipity too played its part when they 
		chanced to meet Bob and Kay who were spending a winter holiday in Puako. 
		Bob offered to spend an afternoon at the Ben woodshop giving Renée 
		hands-on pointers – lessons in technique that became a regular part of 
		those January visits to Hawaii for several years. Bob even gifted Renée 
		with one of his specially produced signature gouges – a long-shanked 
		beauty with two-toned ebony handle. She began turning out product with a 
		ferocious speed and her output was both impressive and most desirable. 
		Unfortunately dust from the finishing process proved toxic to her 
		health. She even resorted to turning whilst completely encased in a 
		space-age style protective suit replete with an outside air source! 
		Still, despite such valiant attempts to mitigate the dust/health 
		problem, she was forced to end her feverish production after far too short 
		a time. She is an amazing talent whose bowls are 
		amongst some of the best I’ve found here in Hawaii.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="g-ben-edit-4-sm.jpg" width="434" height="250" align="right">Gerald Ben likewise is well-known for his turning artistry. The 
		first pieces I saw (and collected) by this accomplished woodworker were 
		a combination of ceramic vessels with crenellated rims to which were 
		fitted amazing turned tops. Their existence was the happy result of 
		Gerald having his head in two camps simultaneously. He even had a 
		ceramic studio set up at his home so he could flit from one medium to 
		the other! The resulting pieces from that melding were both inspiring 
		and very collectible. 
		<img border="0" src="g-ben-edit-3-sm.jpg" width="196" height="156" align="left">He was invited to show a collection of these 
		special combined pieces in Tokyo at a Ginza Gallery where the show was 
		almost completely sold out. This was an amazing response to a first time 
		exhibition by a foreigner in a nation known for its ceramic history. 
		Gerald went onto produce a number of wooden bowls at the same time as 
		his wife was working and indeed they collaborated on several – 
		co-signing them on the foot. He continues to turn and you can often find 
		his output in the best galleries not to mention their own: Dovetail 
		Gallery above Kailua-Kona in Holualoa.</b></p>
		<p align="left"><b>Several bowl makers seem to confuse size with 
		artistic importance and value. We’ve more than a few of that ilk still 
		plying that route of size over meaning resulting in bowls that for the 
		most are totally heartless. Finishes too are often less than stellar in 
		many cases and overall the resulting bowl becomes both a waste of wood 
		and time. Still there are several more that I’m happy to point out. <br>
		<br>
		Barry Ching is a turning talent of the 
		highest caliber and yet he has not participated in the local turners 
		yearly showcase exhibit for the last several years. But if you look 
		about you can still find examples of his finely honed skill in a few 
		island galleries. A number were still available last fall when I toured 
		gallery venues on Oahu. 
		<img border="0" src="b-ching-2-sm.jpg" width="182" height="180" align="right">Several greatly appealed to my collector 
		instincts as Barry is truly ingenious and his experimental side often 
		triumphs with results that boggle the mind. I ruefully recall selling 
		(NOT collecting for myself) one lovely globular form that appeared set 
		with seventy plus types of wood. 
		<img border="0" src="b-ching-sm.jpg" width="279" height="216" align="left">In fact he had made those oh-so-small 
		elements of all the wood varieties growing in Hawaii. Mixing them in a 
		crazed pattern supported by a resin backing, he created a masterful work 
		that still pulls at my collector’s heart years later. Barry tends to do 
		totally marvelous large works in wood varieties that too many people 
		overlook in favor of Koa. Not to say his Koa pieces aren’t of the best 
		quality but I feel strongly that it is his unique turnings with figured 
		Mango and his paper-thin Norfolk pine vessels that really speak volumes 
		about his level of craftsmanship. <br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="mike%20lee-4.JPG" width="236" height="175" align="right">On Oahu I believe there is no turner comparable to the skill and 
		masterful design of Michael Lee. I chanced on his work in a 
		co-operative gallery in Ward Warehouse where the artists not only fill 
		the space with their work but each sits a share of the hours to keep it 
		open. Showing was a strong variety ranging from silver crafted jewelry 
		to hot glass through the expected two-dimensional, but done exceptionally 
		well. Still the pieces that drew my immediate attention were the koa 
		turnings by this gifted young man. I have since seen a number of his 
		more involved works that incorporate carved figurative imagery over all 
		visible surfaces. But these initial pieces were specially chosen pieces 
		of fine curly koa where signature stippling delicately embellished a 
		portion of each piece. 
		<img border="0" src="mike%20lee-5.JPG" width="594" height="214" align="left">I bought two because I couldn’t decide between 
		them and wish now I had selected an additional one or two more. Michael 
		has been honored many times by both his peers in the craft and by 
		curators who have included his unique wood artistry into special 
		collections and exhibitions in several countries.<br>
		<br>
		Turning (no pun intended) my collection top-for-bottom I note there are 
		many names I have not covered in the few paragraphs above. Some of them 
		are no longer amongst the living but there is just so much space if I want 
		to show you examples of which I’ve written, so….. Take a good look at the 
		next wood turning display you’re passing by. It just might have a gem or 
		two that shouldn’t be left lonely and unsold in that shop.<br>
