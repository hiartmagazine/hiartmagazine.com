							<font size="4"><br>
							An act of creation is an attempt at 
							recreating the world. Every artist is a minidivinity 
							in his or her microdomain. Every microdomain lays 
							claim to being a world. To create a world, however, 
							an artwork has to have capabilities for both 
							reflection and transformation. The world looks back 
							at itself in an artwork that has succeeded in 
							bringing forth some truth about it. For this truth 
							to be perceived, the world of the artwork has to 
							reveal a transformed shape of the actual world. 
							Different aspects of the world (ideas, expressions, 
							states) cohere into unified wholes to bring forth 
							these microcosms of perception and action.<br>
							<br>
							By being an offering of an undivided self, a work 
							brings forth a unified world. In a unified world 
							both form and content are intrinsically intertwined 
							and brought out simultaneously. The more distinction 
							there is between them, the more objectified and 
							fragmented the work is. Any other way of structuring 
							is condemned to formulaic process; the dichotomy 
							between form and content creates an unbridgeable 
							chasm.<br>
							<br>
							While the coherence of form and content may be 
							axiomatic within the confines of a particular 
							aesthetic tradition, it is an altogether different 
							task to create the same strength and unity of vision 
							within new frames of reference. Most tribal art 
							matches its standards to firmly established cultural 
							archetypes. These, in turn, determine a whole 
							variety of aspects: 1) the social role of art 
							(ritual, work, individual, and collective); 2) the 
							psychological profile (what is being expressed and 
							how); 3) the stylistic constraints (how the 
							psychosocial factors manifest in art); and 4) the 
							structures and processes (languages and forms of a 
							particular culture).<br>
							<br>
							Within established archetypal forms there is often a 
							certain amount of rearrangement of the essential 
							elements that mostly give rise to variation. As we 
							glance from one cultural neighborhood to another, it 
							is possible to reduce the great variety of 
							transformed elements to certain skeletal invariants. 
							Similarly, art worlds develop on formal backbones 
							that unify primarily through the variation or static 
							transformation of a limited number of elements. An 
							encounter between two or more cultures gives rise to 
							amalgamations, which then produce new entities 
							capable of structuring new human realities.<br>
							<br>
							Unlike variation and static transformation, 
							synthesis builds on dynamic transformation capable 
							of amalgamating new structures through the 
							introduction of new elements. In its Greek root 
							synthesis means “an action of putting together.” 
							While collage (from the French coller, to glue) 
							simply superposes two diverse structures on the 
							surface level, synthesis melds or merges structures 
							on the deepest, elemental level. To use a scientific 
							analogy, we could say that collage occurs on the 
							biological level of organs or tissues, whereas 
							synthesis occurs on the biochemical or subatomic 
							level.<br>
							<br>
							Most syntheses build in stages. It usually takes 
							long historical periods to crystallize the unique 
							voice of a culture. Some voices may be 
							extraordinarily rich and idiosyncratic yet not 
							easily transplantable. Others may be intrinsically 
							more flexible or provide larger areas of cultural 
							overlapping. In the encounter of two cultures, 
							unless they are mutually exclusive, usually the 
							common denominators are the building blocks of new 
							syntheses. While these intersecting areas provide 
							pivot points for cultural fusion, some elements 
							mutate (transform) to adjust to newly evolved 
							structures. The synthesis of these systems becomes a 
							larger unity that produces its own rules, which 
							often transform the very building blocks that were 
							the basis for amalgamation.<br>
							<br>
							Somewhat akin to naturally selected species, certain 
							cultures show more survivability than others do. The 
							various syntheses produced by African music are a 
							case in point. The Guinea Coast–style polyrhythmic 
							and polymetric practices are largely dependent on 
							percussion group performance. The music of western 
							Sudan, on the other hand, is largely performed by a 
							single vocalist, often accompanied by a string 
							instrument. Out of the whole wealth of African music 
							traditions, the only two that survived among the 
							North American slaves were the ones that did not 
							depend on percussion ensembles. A single vocalist 
							often accompanying himself or herself with a string 
							instrument became a blues singer; an a cappella 
							group became a Gospel choir. Because of the 
							different treatment of slaves in the Caribbean and 
							in South America the percussion group with its 
							typical polyrhythmic and polymetric practice became 
							widespread, creating a large variety of Caribbean 
							and South American music traditions.<br>
							<br>
							Both North and South American syntheses show some 
							invariant as well as transformed elements. Most of 
							the general characteristics of African music remain 
							the backbone of new idioms: the wide emotional and 
							physical range of expression; the strong, 
							repetitive, and steady rhythmic pulse; the 
							trance-inducing responsorial group singing (in 
							Gospel, Caribbean, and South American idioms); the 
							practice of variation and improvisation; and the use 
							of pentatonic and some heptatonic scales.<br>
							<br>
							Most of these general characteristics (except 
							trance-inducing singing) are the common elements in 
							African and west European folk idioms (country and 
							folk), although they greatly differ in the focus, 
							range, and particularities of their constituents.<br>
							<br>
							While the extraordinary expressive range, coupled 
							with particular rhythmic and melodic structure, give 
							a unique African voice, the use of the major-minor 
							harmonic system and reliance on regularity and 
							symmetry of form give a west European flavoring to 
							the synthesis. Whether one considers blues, jazz, 
							reggae or bossa nova, these elements are easily 
							discernible. As one proceeds from the earlier forms 
							to the newer, there is more and more synthesis at 
							work.<br>
							<br>
							Some earlier forms of blues, for example, show 
							closer ties to the African idiom, mainly in form, 
							irregular phrasing, and flexible meter. With the 
							later formal development, there is more reliance on 
							regularity (12-bar) and on a particular harmonic 
							scheme. Jazz further elaborates on the melodic and 
							harmonic schemes, focusing on the improvised song 
							form (32-bar). From the 1960s onward a wealth of 
							promiscuous syntheses between idioms has brought 
							forth varieties of amalgamations that expand the 
							synthetic range as well as create a confusing and 
							chaotic world of aesthetic possibilities.<br>
							<br>
							Today, because of the fragmented nature of art and 
							culture in general, the world looking back at itself 
							sees its image in a broken mirror. Instead of 
							finding powerful new syntheses, we face a patchwork 
							of collaged realities. If the premodern world built 
							its coherence through collectively evolved aesthetic 
							archetypes, the modern world brought forth new 
							collective and individual (private) models to 
							follow. Whereas the modern world heroically opened 
							up the space of new potential, the postmodern has 
							attempted to deliver its promise.<br>
							<br>
							The unity of form and content, which once guaranteed 
							coherent art and culture in general has been broken. 
							It is up to us to reintegrate the pieces. While 
							every created world throws a nostalgic look at the 
							place of its origin, the new synthetic realities 
							remain homeless and uprooted despite apparent 
							material and potential spiritual wealth.</font></td>
