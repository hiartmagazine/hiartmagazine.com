							<font face="Arial"><b><font color="#000000">Portraiture is a daunting task no matter which tool 
							you choose. One of the most misunderstood of these 
							tools is photography. It is generally dismissed as a 
							serious art form because of its pervasiveness
							in our culture; accessible to anyone with the 
							ability to trip a shutter button.<br>
							<br>
							Photographic images dominate our waking hours so 
							much so that we simply take them for granted. There 
							is no glamour or mystery in them as we find in a 
							painting or drawing. No awe inspiring outcome that 
							elicits the classic response from the viewer, the 
							&quot;wow&quot; factor. &quot;I could never learn to do something 
							like that!&quot; &quot;Anybody can take a photograph.&quot; The 
							list of clichéd quotes is endless.<br>
							<br>
							It is my firm belief that the opposite is true. 
							Photography is the most difficult of all mediums to 
							master. In the days before digital imaging the 
							photographer/ artist, whether serious or 
							recreational, processed with light, paper and 
							chemistry the same pictures their counterparts made 
							in paint. Even getting film processed at the drug 
							store or instant results of Polaroid pictures to 
							document family history - whatever the purpose of 
							the photograph, nothing excuses a bad idea, or a 
							poor composition, or design or any of the components 
							of any picture making process<br>
							<br>
							With these thoughts in mind, I want to emphasize 
							that in selecting the images for this book, I 
							applied the same judgments and principles as any 
							other art form or medium. Beyond the technical 
							aspects of digital and film based photography, I 
							look for some quality of the portrait which most 
							successfully responds to the concept of the project, 
							Faces Of Hawaii. Whether the photographer is an 
							accomplished &quot;professional&quot; or a recreational 
							&quot;amateur&quot;, the results must reveal an insight into 
							the nature and character of the subject . There must 
							be a personal engagement between the two. These are 
							some of the qualities I think make a good portrait. 
							It is not that easy. Not a snap.</font></b><font size="4" color="#000000"><br>

							<br>
							<br>
							Orwig’s definition of talent: An innate or inherited 
							ability to do “something”, acted on, and nurtured. 
							I’m not sure or concerned what Mr. Webster has to 
							say about that, but it works for me and means a lot.<br>
							<br>
							Based on personal and family histories of friends 
							and numerous acquaintances I’d say there is more 
							than a grain of truth in there. Talent is often 
							referred to as a “gift”, which implies that it is an 
							ability given at random to somebody who may or may 
							not deserve it. <br>
							<br>
							Whether it’s a gift or genetic inheritance, the 
							outcome is about the same. Some individuals like 
							Picasso tap into their inheritance early in 
							childhood, others like Van Gogh struggle to open the 
							gift later. But it does come out. That’s the “acted 
							on” part. Having a talent is no guarantee of a 
							successful life as an artist (to put that in terms 
							of a Bill Clinton question; “define success”). 
							Nurturing support at an early age certainly helps 
							open the doors of a developing mind. <br>
							<br>
							The environment of the talented child is the key to 
							the door. I’m always reminded of someone like 
							Mozart. He was born into a home full of music. His 
							abilities were recognized at an early age and had 
							the overwhelming support of his father. <br>
							<br>
							There must be a fine line or balance achieved 
							between over nurturing and useful encouragement. I’m 
							reminded of the type of misguided parent who lives 
							through the talent of the child and burns the will 
							out of the child for all the wrong reasons.<br>
							<br>
							On the other hand, some talents arise in spite of 
							the environment. Children born into poverty or other 
							harsh circumstances often survive the hard times and 
							thrive in spite of it all. Two things come to mind 
							in that regard; the intervention of a mentioning 
							presence and the environment shapes the voice of the 
							artist.<br>
							<br>
							From my own experience growing up in rural areas of 
							the Pacific Northwest while moving from one small 
							town to another gave me ample opportunity to become 
							any thing but an artist. Between just plain luck and 
							an incredible number of inspiring teachers from 
							elementary through high schools and eventually 
							college, doors opened and lights went on. Those 
							wonderful people didn’t have to be artistically 
							inclined, they just had to recognize a potential and 
							send the right messages. <br>
							<br>
							The influences of that rural life where everything 
							hinged on issues of reality shaped an artistic 
							vision of reality as the springboard of my own 
							artistic voice. To this day it remains my starting 
							point.<br>

							self confidence are relatively intact. Then the 
							question arises; &quot;How valid is that person's

							What next? It depends again

							work based on the market they deal in. Is it tourist 
							Art? Decorator art? How can they sell it? Will it 
							appeal to the folks from Ohio who want to take home

							<font color="#000000" face="Arial">Screwing up the courage one 
							way or another to face this judgment is no easy task. It requires some degree of detective work on your 
							part to know who you are dealing with. Risk of 
							rejection is always lurking behind every encounter 
							of this or any other kind when we open ourselves up 
							to scrutiny of an art form that's dear to us, by 
							sometimes perfect strangers. At least it's a one on 
							one thing. </font></b></p>
							<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>
							<font color="#000000" face="Arial">

							Another form of judgment we 
							subject ourselves to is the daunting challenge of 
							the juried show. Not the one like the county fair 
							where everything gets in and there are blue ribbons 
							in abundance, but the one where you're in or out. 
							Somehow, that's the most difficult to deal with. 
							Most likely because it's so public. </font></b></p>

							But it's that kind of risk 
							that in my opinion makes us better artists in the 
							long run. Once we get past the fear of rejection 
							threshold, we have to realize that the juror is just 
							part of an editing process. Selecting which shows to 
							enter requires the same detective work as the 
							gallery choices. </font></b></p>

							It all comes down to that 
							same self evaluation that compels you to make art in 
							the first place. Putting your work in the pool with 
							your contemporaries is the best way I know to gauge 
							your progress, increase your inventiveness, and find 
							an authentic voice for yourself. Stagnation is the 
							downfall of those who are serious about their 
							artwork.&nbsp; 
							Entering a variety of juried shows keeps fresh ideas 
							coming, especially for the younger artists. It also 
							exposes them to the attention of a broader range of 
							support for their ideas. You could look at the 
							process of subjecting your work to increasing levels 
							of judgment as a poker game of rising stakes. How 
							much of your ego, self confidence, and knowledge of 
							your craft are you willing to bet? </font></b></td>

							<font color="#000000">Where have all the grad students gone? They’ve gone 
							to the mainland every one! It seems that every time 
							I’ve made it over to Honolulu from Maui to get my 
							fix of inspired art, one of my stops, if I time it 
							right, is to see what the Honolulu Academy of Arts 
							has to offer in the annual Artists of Hawaii 
							exhibit. <br>
							<br>
							Most of the time I’m delighted by the number of 
							fresh new works of recent graduates of the 
							university. For the most part the pieces are 
							thoughtful, introspective, and well crafted. A sign 
							of good teaching and programming? What ever it is, 
							seems to be working. They grace the walls of the new 
							wing and, like so many flowers, they fade away. 
							Where do these promising minds go and why is it that 
							after the show, few of them remain to pursue their 
							futures here? <br>
							<br>
							There are the obvious possibilities; living space, 
							art market, isolation from direct access to major 
							art centers like Los Angeles, New York or Chicago (to 
							name a few). I could take each one of these 
							items and deal with them in great depth. Would they 
							lead to the “answer” to the question? Is there 
							something more to consider? What am I overlooking?<br>
							<br>
							It takes a fair amount of money to live here, but 
							the big cities aren’t that much cheaper. The art 
							market/ audience is an illusive thing driven by the 
							“Paradise factor”. We live in a tropical fishbowl 
							attracting spenders from all over the world. But who 
							are they really? And what do they expect or 
							encourage from us? I think it’s fair to say that 
							grad school art is not at the top of most outsiders’ 
							lists of art to buy, collect, or support. That’s 
							just your average tourist/visitor. What about the 
							serious consumer/ user/ appreciator of things other 
							than post card art? Some artists have found niches 
							in mainland collecting markets, but often times 
							these are not home grown artists, but transplants 
							who bring their support sources with them. They may 
							live full or part time on Maui, Oahu, Kauai or Hawaii, 
							but the museums, collectors, buyers come to them. 
							(Lucky artists!)<br>
							<br>
							If we look to our university system to produce the 
							bulk of these promising souls, the questions can 
							take another turn. How many art students are from 
							the home front? How many are from out of state and 
							will return to the mainland/main stream? <br>
							<br>
							While these questions and comments may explain or 
							address the issues relating to the comings and 
							goings of grad students, they lead me to thoughts 
							about the other artists in Paradise and the artist in 
							the real world. If we confine our discussion to 
							contemporary “fine art”, can one produce and sustain 
							a level of world class competitive art and afford to 
							live here without a day job. But the big question is 
							still “is work done here comparable to work done in Metropolis. 
							Based on what I’ve seen over the years, I’d say for 
							the most part, Yes, but…. <br>
							<br>
							Will we ever be able to say there is a legitimate 
							Hawaii “scene” that’s the equal to the California; 
							or New York scenes? I think its here, but fractured 
							and on a fairly small scale by comparison and, for 
							some of the reasons I hope I’ve addressed.</font></b><font color="#000000" size="4"><br>
