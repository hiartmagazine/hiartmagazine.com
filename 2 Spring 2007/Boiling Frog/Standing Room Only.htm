		After the rains, a mud puddle forms in the vacant lot next door. Soon 
		strands of a mysterious-looking viscous substance lined with a multitude 
		of tiny black dots can be found floating in the puddle. The translucent 
		strands are so long that lifting one high over head; both ends might 
		still dangle in the water. <font COLOR="#ffffff">--------------------</font><br>
		<br>
		These are toad eggs. Tomorrow they’ll hatch into thousands of limbless 
		black tadpoles wriggling about in an inch or so of water to compete for 
		the limited quantity of sustenance offered by the puddle.

		<br>
		Through days the sun beats down and the puddle dries up. But heroically 
		I arrive just in time to rescue hundreds of gasping tadpoles from 
		becoming a gray smear in the mud, just another fossil memory of toad 
		love. In my aquarium at home the tadpoles sprout legs and transform into 
		young toads, hopping about amusingly, gradually consuming larger and 
		larger quantifies of fish food.</font><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">
		Finally overwhelmed by their voracity, I release them back out into the 
		world. They hop off to live out their amphibious lives, eating, sleeping 
		and reproducing just like the rest of us. <font COLOR="#ffffff">

		What if every one of you did the same thing, too? The beginnings of a 
		humanistic movement? Perhaps a social revolution...

		more each hour! Nearly two million every week—100 million more each
