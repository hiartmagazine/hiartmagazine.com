		<p>The Jellyfish Directive</p>
		</font>
		<p><br>
		<font size="4">Two jellyfish drift haplessly below the surface of the 
		Pacific Ocean. The current is warm where the jellyfish float and neither 
		is inclined to go deeper where the pressures grow great, the light 
		dimmer and the water colder—nor is either inclined to approach the 
		surface where predatory oceangoing birds might pluck one up by the 
		crown, hauling it away to desiccate on some beach, a gelatinous dessert 
		for some seafaring scavenger.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">As the current carries them they debate an issue which 
		has preoccupied marine coelenterates for eons: the existence of free 
		will.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">“The capacity of a creature to act of its own 
		volition, undetermined by physical or divine forces generally implies 
		the existence of consciousness,” asserts the first. “But given the tiny 
		ganglion clusters with which you and I are working, that could not be at 
		issue,” it submits, raising its umbrella-like disk to reveal the small 
		nerve pillar which directs its actions.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Jellyfish are by nature non-confrontational creatures 
		but an indictment of the parameters of its very existence brings a scowl 
		to the translucent visage of the second: “In my estimation, 
		consciousness is overrated,” it replies, waving its tentacles heatedly. 
		“The ability to look in a mirror, and recognize your own face is hardly 
		a measure of the capacity to make non-determined decisions!”</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Turning its ambiguous face toward the sky, the first 
		responds: “But self-reflective gray matter implies the potential for 
		reconsideration. Recall the Kantian categorical imperative—Do as you 
		would have all others do in similar circumstances—the unconditional rule 
		of conscience.” </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">It sums up as they continue to drift. “When were you 
		last able to do that?!”</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The second pumps its umbrella up and down indignantly, 
		rising. “Free will is the <i>exercise</i> of the potential for 
		alternative actions in a given situation, nothing more!” it bubbles 
		agitatedly, the reflexive activity turning it pink as it bobs toward the 
		surface.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">“The line between acts of instinct and considered acts 
		of choice is indistinct. Perhaps the <i>appearance</i> of alternatives 
		is the true essence of the only important kind of free will there is...”</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The first jellyfish is affronted by this indiscreet 
		use of mechanistic pragmatism, but with a patience inherited through 
		millennia of unaltered genetic coding, it allows the second to continue.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">“...<i>and</i> using that notion of free will, a 
		jellyfish under duress, might swim up or down—left or right. Nature 
		would judge which decision was favored. But without alternative 
		possibilities there could be no selection, and without selection there 
		could be no evolution.”</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">As the sun dips toward the far horizon, on the craggy 
		shore a man peers into the depths, casting his shadow far out into the 
		rippling Pacific. “Poor pathetic creatures we are!” the man laments, 
		considering two drifting jelly forms. “We wash about in currents of time 
		and place with no control, completely without choice or free will.”</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Meanwhile below, the two jellyfish drift easily 
		through the man’s long shadow, one heading along the ragged shore, while 
		its companion puts out to sea with an abandoned wave of its tentacles 
		and a full genetic cargo of unmade decisions, questions to be asked, and 
		possibilities to be tested.</font><br>
