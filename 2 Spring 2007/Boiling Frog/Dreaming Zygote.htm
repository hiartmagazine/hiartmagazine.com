		<img border="0" src="dreaming-zygote-web.gif" width="250" height="375" align="right">The 
		Dreaming Zygote</font> <br>
		<br>
		<p><font size="4">It had been a long swim for Sperm, so his half of the 
		zygote’s chromosomal information was tired – penetration had exhausted 
		him. Egg, on the other hand was restless. She had been approached many 
		times on her one-way trip to the uterus, but had never before been 
		penetrated, and she wanted more… </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">So their sleep that night was restless. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Finally fusion was complete, and Sperm was lodged 
		firmly and permanently in Egg. They were no longer Sperm and Egg, they 
		had become Zygote; a greater whole than all imaginable halves. They were 
		one cell securely attached to the uterine wall. Desire was ended, 
		competition consummated, they slept, dreaming portentous, single-celled 
		dreams. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Protoplasm splashed up against the cell wall. 
		Pseudopodia reached out into the night. If there had been covers, the 
		might have been kicked off. There was much information to be processed, 
		many decisions to be made, X’s and Y’s to be sorted through. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Morning came and Zygote woke briefly. He had not yet 
		learned to add or subtract, but somewhere in genetic memory he knew that 
		he had to divide before he could multiply: Instinctively he divided, the 
		locus of his identity shifting as he became two, then four cells. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="4">The imperatives of millions of years of evolution 
		weren’t to be denied, s the zygote, now truly an embryo, became a more 
		complex organism, developing the signature oragnelles of his phylogenic 
		ancestors; an amphibious tail which would later regress to form the last 
		vertebra of the spine developed at about three months, then gill slits 
		appeared. He was well adapted to his aquatic habitat and dreamed moist 
		dreams of primeval seas and scaly antecedents. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The embers of limbic consciousness were beginning to 
		glow in ganglion clusters which would become the foundation of Embryo’s 
		brain. A sexual identity emerged and he wondered if he was a sperm 
		dreaming he was a fetus or a fetus dreaming he was a sperm, but at that 
		point it all seemed rather academic. There were still eyes to be dotted 
		and toes to be crossed, and all the fine little hairs of his mammalian 
		ancestors to be distributed over his smooth developing epidermis. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="4">When the contractions finally started, the dreamer was 
		ready. He thrashed like a tiny sperm swimming through thick vaginal 
		fluids up to the womb, but now he was headed downstream. Extreme 
		compression galvanized his epidermis and viscous fluids flowed from his 
		lungs as he was expelled into a dazzling brightness peopled with huge 
		white-clad forms. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">He coughed liquid and gasped air, experiencing the 
		first non-aquatic moment of his existence. The fetus was a baby. They he 
		slept again. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">When he awoke he was alone. The reassuring throb of 
		pulse and heart all around had been replaced by silence, broken only by 
		sporadic wailing that tore at Baby’s young psychic fabric. It was the 
		wail of others of his kind awakening from their own billion-year dreams.
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The pulsing womb was now just a memory of lost unity, 
		a throb within his heaving chest. It had been a rude awakening, a sad 
		ending to the dream of eons. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Reaching back deep into phylogenic memory, Baby thrust 
		out a pseudopod, a fin, an arm, and rolled helplessly onto his side. The 
		unrelenting vista of unrelenting identical barred containers – cribs – 
		time capsules for the return of captured time-travelers, receptacles for 
		a planet’s most complex progeny. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">An unfamiliar throb of panic pulsed in Baby’s chest. 
		He felt truly alone for the first time. Sensations of separation cycled 
		through his freshly myelin zed cerebellum, in search of translation and 
		further interpretation. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The memories of an age of plurality were truncated, 
		left echoing in his cells. But those reverberations launched his still 
		dormant frontal cortex in search of his past, his future, and an 
		ultimate reunion. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Baby caught the eye of his nearest neighbor, a fleshy 
		pink creature, like himself, tucked under a white blanket. Mustering his 
		strength he coughed up a little mucus, and paraphrased the immortal Yogi 
		Berra: “It’s kinda like ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny all over 
		again, ain’t it?” </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">A curious far away look passed over his companion as 
		she considered the levels of redundancy in his comment. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">“Yes, kinda,” she returned thoughtfully then rolled 
		over nodding off to sleep.</font></p>
