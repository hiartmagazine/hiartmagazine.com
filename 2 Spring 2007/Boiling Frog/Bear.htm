		Bear decided it was time for a change. It was late summer and the heat 
		was bothering him. Each year, it seemed to grow hotter. The river was 
		drying to a trickle and food was scarce. He headed north following the 
		receding glaciers.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">An ice age was passing but even a bear 
		moves faster than a glacier. So Bear didn’t have to go far. When he 
		reached the cold, he wintered in a hollow tree a hundred miles from 
		where he began. He didn’t wake until spring.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">Then, as so often happens to bears on the 
		move, Bear was distracted before he could resume his journey by that 
		other more imperative call of nature, procreation. Bear mated and 
		settled there by the hollow tree. He and his mate had five offspring.<br>
		<br>
		One of them with a particularly long, warm fur coat – we’ll call him 
		Bear, too – continued the trip north, motivated by the receding ice and 
		sweaty palms that come with thick fur.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">Generation after generation spanning 
		thousands of years Bear (we’ll call all of his descendants ‘Bear’ now, 
		since they were evolving into a distinct genus) moved north, selected by 
		nature’s mechanisms for a warm, sleek white coat more and more suited to 
		the polar extremity which would be his ultimate destination.<font COLOR="#ffffff">..... 
		.............................................................</font><br>
		Ten thousand years later Bear finally made it, and he was hungry. Fish 
		were hard to come by swimming beneath the ice, so he looked to the 
		Arctic seal for his next meal. Our new genus, Polar Bear became a 
		predator upon the timid seal—an environmental pressure slowly driving 
		seals from their arctic habitat.<br>
		<br>
		A slow, simple and even romantic dance ensued; Bear and seal, one 
		leading, one following, across latitudes and ages. As new adaptive seals 
		(Seals) moved south, away from the Polar Regions toward more temperate 
		zones, adaptive bears would follow until a new balance was created and 
		then broken again.<font COLOR="#ffffff">.<br>
		</font>
		<br>
		But during Bear’s ten thousand year expedition, and of course over the 
		millions of years that preceded it, men were also evolving. There were 
		men and then there were Men. And thick furry coats weren’t among their 
		adaptive features. Men had developed tools and new ways of adapting, 
		through behavior.<br>
		<br>
		Despite their relatively diminutive size, slowness of foot, their short 
		jaws, and small canine teeth, Men with their new Brains were terrific 
		hunters. And in those equatorial latitudes, bears—those now distant 
		cousins of Bear’s—were easily hunted and killed by Men (while Polar Bear 
		remained safely at the North Pole).</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">Bear meat might have been tastier than 
		camel but the real bonus was a bear fur coat. A Man might kill a bear 
		and donning this previously-owned coat, he could migrate to the North 
		Pole in only the time it required to walk, ride or drive there: a ten 
		thousand year journey for a bear effectively duplicated by a Man in 
		months!<font COLOR="#ffffff">.........................................................................................</font><br>
		Generations of seals had no time to become new adaptive Seals and fell 
		prey to this new Man. Even our highly adapted Polar Bear was unable to 
		find a speedy back door exit from which to escape this situation. Nature 
		provided no way for Bear or Seal or many of the other creatures in the 
		path of this new behaviorally adaptive Man to compensate. Extinction was 
		often the result.<font COLOR="#ffffff"> 
		................................................................................................</font><br>
		Our well traveled Bear might have found his final resting place on a 
		hanger in a well appointed department store. But what about Man? Is man 
		nature’s final predator?</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">For a moment let’s not talk about nature 
		but about Nature—the great umbrella under which even greater 
		compensations are, even as we speak, being made. Nature is an additive 
		system; it always carries the biggest stick. Within Nature 
		responsibility is a relative issue – but humans are mortal and Nature is 
		ultimately responsible.</font></p>
