						A single cell floats through an endless ocean, its 
						identity, firmly lodged in the center of its 
						cytoplasm—its nucleus. There is no confusion. From time 
						to time the cell divides, leaving progeny to float off 
						according to the ocean’s currents, never to be known and 
						seldom to be encountered again by the parent cell. The 
						offspring are usually perfect duplicates of the original 
						with only occasional tiny differences. But in the ocean 
						of lime, one of those mutative differences results in a 
						unique cell which divides its nucleus to release its 
						progeny into the world, but never quite lets go. The 
						offspring remains tenaciously attached to its twin and 
						partner.</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">This unprecedented 
						event is duplicated again each time the original cell 
						divides—a genetic habit which turns out to be a 
						comfortable arrangement for both parties. Certain 
						advantages are created by the proximity of cells and the 
						new creature thrives and multiplies. Cells divide and 
						cluster. A colony of near identical cells functioning as 
						a single unit is created. Let’s call it a Volvox. It is 
						a bridge between an ocean of acellular algae and an 
						almost inconceivable multiplicity of complex species.</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The potentials are 
						extraordinary, almost unspeakable, especially for Volvox, 
						which have no lips. This new creature is a cooperative 
						organism, a cellular condominium selected for its 
						capacity to survive in a different ecological niche from 
						the multitude of isolated &quot;volvox-parts&quot; which continue 
						to drift separately across the water. But deep within 
						the nucleus of that first original volvox cell, 
						questions have formed:</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
						<i>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Once there had been a 
						true, clear individuality, but now what could really be 
						said to comprise identity as a part of this new 
						creature? Is a singular cell still an entity living in 
						association with other similar entities for a common 
						purpose, or has its identity as an independent 
						autonomous creature been forever compromised? What is a 
						truly personal (cellular) concern, and what are the 
						directed actions and concerns of the greater Volvox 
						which has been created?</font></p>
						</i>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The cell had become an 
						unwitting partner in the world’s first condominium 
						development and it wasn’t entirely happy with the 
						situation. Its consciousness (such as it was) began 
						vacillating back and forth between its normal 
						independent cellular state and a new unfamiliar modular 
						consciousness.</font></p>
						<i>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Was it becoming part 
						of a much larger whole, the totality of which is almost 
						inconceivable? Or was its identity just slowly 
						dissolving, diluted to insignificance in a great soupy 
						ectoplasm? Observed from an outside point of view (if 
						there was such a point of view) the larger Volvox entity 
						might be considered either a single creature made up of 
						parts, or a colony of individuals coming together for 
						mutual convenience.</font></p>
						</i>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The moral implications 
						alone were shattering: Must each aspect of the greater 
						whole then have concern for the welfare of the entirety 
						or had individual responsibility been completely 
						abrogated in a vast new multi-cellular consciousness?</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">If interconnectedness 
						implies biological responsibility then what of the other 
						creatures with which Volvox was linked (albeit more 
						distantly)? What of the hapless euglena or the 
						rudimentary bacteria which break down raw materials into 
						bite sized chunks on which a Volvox might feed?</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">And that single cell 
						evolved from agglomerations of bacteria-like elements 
						whose sum was now the elemental cell itself. Where are 
						the edges of identity and responsibility? What of the 
						ocean in which a Volvox swims, the Earth beneath it and 
						the sky and sun above? There is undoubtedly interaction 
						and interdependence—some kind of connection. Could this 
						imply a still higher level of identity?</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The idea of such a 
						great self was dizzying, even exalting and the cell was 
						for a moment tempted to embrace the concept of still 
						larger and larger selves.</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">But envisioning the 
						vastness of this new greater identity the cell glimpsed 
						just how thinly its tiny consciousness might be spread 
						through so vast a whole. Vertigo overwhelmed the cell. 
						The nucleus rushed a message to its mitochondria—its 
						internal medicine cabinet—ordering an extra large dose 
						of its endogenous cellular painkillers.</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Falling into a 
						semi-conscious stupor, the cell settled into a twilight 
						consciousness, dreaming of greater selves that spanned 
						oceans, rivers and mountains...solar systems and 
						galaxies.</font></p>
						<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The dream spread 
						throughout the entire Volvox condominium—a dream carried 
						down through generation upon generation of 
						multi-cellular creatures: a dream that lasts as long as 
						multi-cellular creatures swim the seas, walk the land, 
						and fly through the skies of this verdant planet.</font></td>
