		<p><font size="4"><br>
		The keeper of the chimpanzee cage was a well-read man of culture who 
		fancied himself a zoologist and humanitarian more than a mere animal 
		custodian. He often found himself staring for long moments into the cage 
		of his ward, wondering whether in some primal jungle he might truly have 
		shared an ancestor with this creature.<br>
		<br>
		Zoos, however, are set up largely for the entertainment and edification 
		of their human patrons; so in fact, the keeper’s duties were evenly 
		divided between the front and rear ends of his charge. In the morning 
		the keeper brought food for the chimp and in the afternoon, after the 
		patrons had left, he cleaned dung from the cage floor.<br>
		<br>
		The chimpanzee himself, though, was no ordinary simian; he was a true 
		student of human nature. Often in the afternoon he would lie back in his 
		cage as if in a movie theater, munching a snack, watching through 
		half-closed eyes, the curious passers- by. They would make strange 
		faces, hooting or grunting at him, awaiting some response, then meeting 
		his riveting gaze they would turn away uneasily as if unsure as to which 
		side of the bars they were on and who really was the entertainment.<br>
		<br>
		After the zoo had closed it was just the keeper and his charge. The two 
		would find themselves staring through the bars into each other’s primate 
		faces for long moments in search of common ground. Occasionally the 
		keeper, finding himself racked with guilt over the chimp’s sad fate, 
		would vilify his species in philosophic monologue regarding moral 
		responsibility, fancying that through some unknown mechanism, a real 
		psychic connection might be developing... <br>
		<br>
		… Which, in reality, there was, since over the years the chimp had come 
		to understand human language. Given vocal chords which had been selected 
		millions of years earlier for snarls and grunts rather than how’s and 
		thou’s, the chimp, of course had never found means to articulate his 
		thoughts. But over time the symbolism of letters on signs posted on and 
		about his cage had gradually become intelligible to him:<br>

		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Written language had in fact, come to 
		intrigue him, and so for long hours the chimp would practice imitating 
		the letters in the sawdust litter on the cage floor. Discovering the 
		confusion of etched letters exacerbated the keeper’s guilt. He excitedly 
		embarked upon what he considered had become a moral duty–educating his 
		semi-literate charge. Today word-salad, tomorrow perhaps Henry IV!
		<font COLOR="#ffffff">-<br>
		-------------------------------------------</font><br>
		As the ape mastered symbolic syntax he became an avid and curious 
		consumer of Western Literature. Each book the keeper brought him to read 
		though, triggered questions which the chimp would scratch into the 
		sawdust and feces on his cage floor. The questions inevitably suggested 
		a new literary pursuit to the keeper, a process, which over time 
		described the form and direction of the chimp’s continuing education.
		<br>
		<br>
		For each of the ape’s questions, the keeper sought an appropriate and 
		responsible answer from the body of human intellectual endeavor. But for 
		every good answer the keeper supplied, the chimp had another question. 
		And finally, with the inevitability of tides, the question of 
		responsibility arose—the ontology of man and ape—a literary cul de sac 
		for a true believer like the keeper. <font COLOR="#ffffff">----------- 
		----<br>
		</font>But the keeper regarded the question seriously and in response to 
		the chimp’s anxious questioning, brought him the only two authoritative 
		books he could find with divergent views on the issue. One was The Holy 
		Bible and the other was Darwin’s The Origin of Species.

		--------------------</font><br>
		In the morning he returned to find the chimp sitting cross-legged on the 
		floor in the corner of his cage, drumming his fingers intently, staring 
		curiously at the keeper. A new question was scratched into the litter on 
		the concrete floor:</font></td>
