		<p>The Humpty-Dumpty Phenomenon</p>
		</font>
		<p><br>
		<font size="4">Ghengis Khan loved cheetahs.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">No, not graffiti on some Shanghai 
		bathroom wall. The emperor of all Russia, China and Persia was a 
		collector of symbols of power, and the great Khan had a particular 
		passion for the cheetah, the world’s fastest feline. The conqueror from 
		Marco Polo’s tales actually went so far as to mobilize all his horses 
		and his men, sending them out to collect every cheetah they could find 
		in Southwest Asia.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">They were actually quite successful, 
		bringing a significant fraction of the population of cheetah to Ghengis 
		Kahn’s compound in China. One thing however that Ghengis never achieved 
		was to convince his cheetah to breed in captivity. Following lives in 
		which the high points were probably the mauling of a few Christians, the 
		thousands of cheetah in the Kahn entourage died. Their genetic heritage 
		remained unpacked baggage on some molecular way-station in the Far East.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Meanwhile in the jungles of Southeast 
		Asia the number of remaining cheetah had been reduced to a relative 
		handful. A close shave for the cheetah? Perhaps closer than you think: 
		There are some things that can be broken apart and put back together, 
		others that can’t; reversible and irreversible phenomena.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">For millennia the cheetah had outrun 
		evolution, its highly developed torso musculature, and incredibly 
		flexible spine making it the fastest mammal on the planet, capable of 
		bursts of speed up to sixty miles per hour. Comparative anatomists tell 
		us that a cheetah, with all four limbs removed, might still have ‘run’ 
		at six miles per hour simply by flexing its spine—fast for a creature 
		with no legs!<font COLOR="#ffffff">............................................................................................................</font><br>
		But when environmental pressure threatens a species, evolution doesn’t 
		run, it walks. Step by step, genetic memory acquired over eons and 
		stored in the variety and multiplicity of individuals within a system, 
		is tested for solutions. Biological history is a memory contained in the 
		genetic material of every creature involved in an ecosystem. </font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">In the massive loss of population 
		triggered by Ghengis’ affections, the cheetah had effectively lost much 
		of its biological memory. With all its speed and specialization, the 
		cheetah found itself out on an evolutionary limb.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Imagine a crisis in which only 
		selection from among the variety within a population can restore 
		balance. Diversity is then the key to adaptability, and each individual 
		variation becomes a unique answer to a question asked of life by time.
		</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The cheetah had very few solutions 
		left to bring to any environmental duress. In Southeast Asia the cheetah 
		is now extinct; the few cheetahs remaining in Africa are so genetically 
		identical that a skin graft can be successfully transferred between 
		unrelated individuals. Even human brothers and sisters can’t do that! 
		Variety within the remaining cheetah population is also virtually 
		extinct and the African cheetah may well follow.<br>

		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Time—the history of life on our planet 
		in all its minute details—is codified in the variety and multiplicity of 
		forms within our ecosystem. Filed within the nuclei of the cells of each 
		creature is a library of living history. With enough horses and men—with 
		enough technology—we might one day replicate all of the length, width 
		and breadth of the cheetah’s DNA, but we’ll never be able to replace its 
		history.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">So what about Humpty-Dumpty? Not 
		enough albumen? The wrong type of glue? Maybe it’s all just a question 
		of time. Life happens in time. Although technology may move faster and 
		faster, still—alongside the cheetah—king’s horses and king’s men 
		everywhere continue to march irreversibly and in one direction only.</font></p>
