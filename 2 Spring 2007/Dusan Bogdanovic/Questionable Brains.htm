						An African mask, a Balinese cremation ceremony, a 
						whirling dervish trance, a painting by Vermeer: they all 
						present indissoluble wholes. The forms and content of 
						this art are bound by particularities of the aesthetic 
						processes involved as much as by the rules and 
						regulations of their social milieus. In order to be just 
						to any of these cultural products, we have to understand 
						them in the light of their proper context and history.<br>
						<br>
						Ethnic art is an integrative part of a tribal reality. 
						Taken out of its world, ethnic art becomes a museum 
						piece, an object of veneration, a Ph.D. dissertation, 
						and a possibly lucrative source of income. In its place 
						of origin, however, most tribal art has very specific 
						psychosocial functions. Rites and rituals, for one, 
						reinforce the social bonds among tribe members, 
						integrating various aspects of individual and social 
						dynamics.<br>
						<br>
						One role of rituals is to create a unified vision of the 
						cosmogony and mythology of a particular tribe. Hand in 
						hand with what has been (historical reality), and what 
						is (present reality), come visions of what might be 
						(future potentialities).<br>
						<br>
						The vertical structuring of the self (the depth of 
						history) coalesces with horizontal structuring (the 
						expansion of the present) to create stable individual 
						and social identities. Religion and art in their fused, 
						syncretic form become a tremendously powerful 
						integrating force for the anxiety-ridden premodern 
						individual. The chasm between the instinctual and the 
						human-created reality is bridged, and the schism is 
						temporarily healed.<br>
						<br>
						All art reflects its ethnic sources. Its stylistic 
						oscillations vary historically and within the bounds of 
						a particular language. The music of Bach, while soaring 
						to mathematically constructed heights, nevertheless 
						reveals a metric profile of west European folk music. 
						There is nothing in the history of Western art music 
						that can compare to the polyrhythmic complexity of 
						African, or to the melodic refinement of Indian, music. 
						The expressive distortions of African masks had to wait 
						for Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon to find their 
						match in Western art. Thus although a multiplicity of 
						cultural forms has existed throughout the development of 
						Western civilization, its full impact has remained a 
						marginal possibility until the twentieth century. The 
						inevitable development from “the raw to the cooked to 
						the gourmet” reflects the process of refinement and 
						increasing complexity of most cultures. Western 
						cultural hegemony, however, has not only been built on 
						brilliant recipes. The legitimacy of its success has 
						been built on artistic achievement as much as on its 
						economic and political power.<br>
						<br>
						If Western art shows a powerful coherence and a 
						fluctuating cosmopolitanism in creating its universal 
						canons, it also reveals a tight restraint on the 
						instinctual and a certain colonial attitude to ethnic 
						art. This attitude is a symptom of the general Western 
						habit of “objectifying” reality, a habit that perhaps 
						interferes with a genuine understanding of the art of 
						others. At worst, the influence of ethnic art on Western 
						art has produced little more than a makeover, such as 
						“Chinoiserie” in the visual arts or the “whitened jazz” 
						of American popular music. At best, ethnic influence has 
						become a vehicle for new syntheses that can stand on 
						their own.<br>
						<br>
						With the inevitable expansion of communication 
						technologies, the incorporation of tribal art becomes a 
						given. Human consciousness naturally expands to 
						encompass all created art. To say that art today should 
						be limited to either Western or tribal art is a form of 
						fundamentalism that most thinking people would not 
						subscribe to. On the other hand, an indiscriminate 
						artistic promiscuity creates a state of confusion that 
						treats genuine artistic realities as candies to be 
						consumed at will, independent of their actual entity and 
						history.<br>
						<br>
						Because of these freshly acquired territories, a new, 
						multicultural art industry is blossoming. But, instead 
						of genuine artistic realities (in the context of their 
						place in tribal life), we are given three-minute 
						segments in which to discern exotic qualities. “Experts” 
						are sold to us as representing particular cultures, and 
						anybody else is waved aside as not being a legitimate 
						artist. Should anybody from the Balkans (myself 
						included) have an exclusive copyright on odd rhythms? 
						Should anybody Chinese have an exclusive right to 
						calligraphy?<br>
						<br>
						Good art does not have any extraneous guarantees. It is 
						the integrity, the coherence of its elements and 
						processes, the authenticity of its statement and 
						expression, its ability to stand by itself that give a 
						work of art its strength and longevity. Of course, no 
						art object stands in a vacuum; there are frames of 
						reference that establish its intelligibility and its 
						context. Whereas tribal art matches its standards to an 
						artistic archetype, Western art matches its standards to 
						historically fluctuating aesthetic postulates and 
						models.<br>
						<br>
						While both tribal and Western art have more or less 
						clear frames of reference, the newly evolving synthetic 
						culture inhabits a no-man’s-land. What has been 
						promulgated as the new multicultural, global art shows 
						as much fragmentation and entropy as anything the pop 
						industry has created. Repackaged ethnic art, taken out 
						of context, is simplified and made palatable to an 
						artistically bulimic public. It is the particularities 
						and idiosyncrasies of ethnic art that give it depth and 
						strength, not the “beige” quality of commercial efforts.<br>
						<br>
						This does not mean, however, that value lies only in 
						purism and efforts to conserve the authentic. Most 
						cultures are mishmashes of various influences that 
						crystallize into unique synthetic products. To 
						successfully synthesize new cultural realities, we first 
						have to fully assimilate the depth of their particular 
						systems of reference and then to acknowledge the 
						structural pivots that lie in the intersections of their 
						very being.<br>
						<br>
						Our common human ancestry, our need for a variety of 
						experiences, point to an ability to assimilate diverse 
						cultures and thereby to expand the potential of our own 
						humanity. Building a new, unique cosmopolitan culture 
						must encompass both the individualities and the 
						commonalities of its participants. Anything short of 
						building this edifice from the basement up is bound to 
						leave us all fluttering, uprooted in an artificially 
						created cyberspace.</font><p><font size="4"><br>
