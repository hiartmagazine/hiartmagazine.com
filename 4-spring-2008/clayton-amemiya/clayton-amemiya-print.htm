		Twelve years ago, following decades 
						as a professional potter studying the arcane techniques 
						and methodologies of our near extinct alchemy, I walked 
						into the studio of Clayton Amemiya and saw a vessel the 
						likes of which I'd never seen before. The object seemed 
						to float in its own private space on the table. It 
						wasn't unstable, but well grounded. It was neither 
						symmetrical, nor truly asymmetrical, neither really 
						centered in the bilateral way potters understand 
						products of the wheel, nor perceptibly lop-sided. The 
						glaze was similarly mystical. It was sophisticated, yet 
						raw and primitive. There was a sense of great purpose to 
						the vessel, belied by an extraordinary informality. The 
						impression of accident encapsulated in the vessel wasn't 
						the sort of purposeful calamity we perceive in a circus 
						clown's precarious tightrope walk – it was balanced, but 
						seemed an object still mobile in space and time.<br>
							<br>
							When I asked the potter how this&nbsp; vessel was 
							crafted, he explained to me that the hollow form was 
							essentially wheel thrown, manipulated by hand, then 
							offered to his unique kiln – the anagama.</font></td>

		This kiln 
						wasn't simply for hardening and glazing ware as most 
						modern kilns are, the anagama was the hand which 
						completed the form of the vessel. Bowls, vases and 
						platters were meticulously stacked into the single 
						chamber, hill-side kiln. Firey gases would flow across 
						the prepared ware, appropriating the potter's markings 
						to their own device. The artist becomes a lens through 
						which the greater forces of human nature, historic 
						culture, and the nature of matter itself is focused into 
						singularities. Understanding little, I left, but 
						returned again and again for over a decade to observe 
						the making of ware through this unique process.</font></td>

		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In the studio a new series begins. On the potter's 
						wheel, vessels are created by harnessing centrifugal 
						force, coaxing clay into form. For a moment the material 
						spins between displacing fingers, determining a still 
						point in space. Pliable clay conforms, rotating away, 
						then returning in circuit to its point of origin, 
						forming an orbit. As the potter's hands rise, the motion 
						translates circle into spiral upon the plastic medium, 
						approximating concentric circles which define volume. 
						Near magically, a vessel appears upon the wheel.<br>
						<br>
						With the advent of the electric wheel, the potter's hand 
						has tended to move more slowly while clay spins faster 
						and faster, allowing the created spiral to offer an 
						illusion of near perfect symmetry. But on the kick 
						wheel, Clayton's hands move quickly, while his wheel 
						moves slowly, exaggerating spirals which precipitate a 
						moment of near irreversible asymmetry. Then he releases 
						the clay and begins again. A
						second and third spiral capture the emerging form in a 
						net of influencing forces giving rise to a unique 
						improvisation, an object of asymmetric balance. He lifts 
						the resultant memory of process easily off the wheel, 
						places it upon the waiting shelf, and moves on to the 
						next.<br>

						into pottery, the glassy residue which once accidentally 
						collected upon the surface of wood fired ware has been 
						co-opted into glaze. Through generations of experiment, 
						formulations of glass-like powder have been artfully 
						applied to hardened clay vessels, simultaneously 
						ornamenting them, and rendering them impervious to 
						liquid. Today, most kilns are fueled by gas or 
						electricity, and fuse glaze onto vessel in a process 
						lasting just a few hours. The anagama kiln however, 
						fires for four days and nights without stop, using only 
						highly specific woods combusted continuously to create 
						sustained heat. The accumulation of ash upon the wares 
						comprises the body of glaze.<br>

		As the anagama is loaded, vessels are perched upon sea 
						shells impregnated with clay to balance and separate the 
						pieces. At the front of the kiln, the fire is lit. Heat, 
						smoke and ash are drawn up the sloping chamber into a 
						tall chimney elevated by the hillside. Fingers of flame 
						and ash reach through the stack of wares for a hundred 
						hours. The memory of the path of fire through bowls, 
						within cups and under platters, accumulates a residue of 
						molten ash. The tilt of vessel, and the secret path of 
						gas around solid, leaves a footprint that might be read 
						by the knowing eye, emoting the passage of geological 
						time upon the fossilized artifacts of an artist's hand.<br>
