								<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Art has flowed from Darrell Orwig ever since 
								he came to Hawaii from Chico State College in 
								the 70s. With a mischievous twinkle in his eye, 
								he worked through his mysterious Kaena Point 
								Series to major corporate commissions and on to 
								war paintings. In 1991, then-LTJG Orwig, USCGR 
								documented the Persian Gulf War via 16 paintings 
								that are now part of the Coast Guard art 
								collection. Each step of the way Orwig discovers 
								and shares his enthusiasm for life in the 
								mysterious present. </p>
								<p>With his paintings Orwig focuses on the 
								miracle of what is right before our eyes. He 
								relishes the excitement of qualities observed in 
								our everyday environment that we may either 
								dismiss or overlook and he shares his 
								eye-opening experiences. His paintings are the 
								answer to the questions: &quot;What does the painter 
								see? What does he get excited about, seek to 
								capture, interpret, recreate, and share?&quot; His 
								images are paths for empathy, seeing, and 
								feeling with the artist what he perceives.</p>
								<p>We often see only what we expect to see. 
								After seeing travel advertisements, our 
								expectations and experiences upon arrival at the 
								actual place are framed and colored by those 
								already-seen cliché images held in our memory. 
								Orwig's paintings snap viewers out of such 
								limited prejudgments. He challenges our 
								assumptions regarding what is worth paying 
								attention to and what is not. He teases us by 
								first letting us think that what we are seeing 
								is mundane.<br>
								<br>
								Part of what these pictures are about is 
								photography's impact. Orwig is dealing with the 
								nature of photography and its pervasive, 
								immediate and accessible role in our lives. The 
								world is inundated with photo imagery and after 
								awhile we fail to notice how it can either limit 
								or expand awareness.<br>
								<br>
								Darrell Orwig makes ongoing use of the camera as 
								an exploratory tool, a sketching device. His 
								method for uncovering a deeper reality is 
								influenced by his many years living in and 
								seeing travel shots being generated by the 
								millions in tourist-Mecca Hawaii. The rounded 
								corners on his images recall the past's 
								ubiquitous Kodachrome slides of family travel. 
								In Orwig's eyes and hands the snapshot totally 
								breaks the lookout-spot, take-your-picture-here 
								mold. For Orwig, it's not the designated lookout 
								point or the exotic destination of postcard 
								fame; it's the wonder of what we may have missed 
								along the way.<br>
								<br>
								Many voices are orchestrated here within the 
								voice of the artist. They include the voices of 
								brush, paint, color, and composition. The 
								brushed-in paint colors dance in interacting 
								waves of dynamic balance. With these means, 
								Orwig represents those perceptions that awaken a 
								special awareness of time, light, and space. For 
								such perceptions to occur, specific subjects are 
								either irrelevant or only part of the story. 
								What is required is a shift in </font>
								<font size="4" face="Arial">
								awareness, a shift in thinking about what is 
								important. It is this kind of shift that is the 
								ground for art. This is what makes it possible 
								for adults to renew the sense of wonder, to see 
								something as if for the first time.<br>
								<br>
								Darrell Orwig has long been interested in the 
								relationships among man-made artifacts and 
								natural places. Such art is not commodity, not 
								mere image recognition. The ultimate value to 
								the artist and to the viewer is what one does 
								with it, what meaning and /or quality of 
								experience one gains from it. It's the handprint 
								on the cave wall, the symbol of insights. It is 
								always possible that viewers won't see it.<br>
								<br>
								How to conjure a unique one-of-a-kind 
								experience? Representational art is only a 
								starting point for Orwig. It's a starting point 
								for his stories. He feels like a kid dying to 
								tell his parents what happened in school. The 
								more he builds in the intensity and excitement 
								of his original vision, the more nuanced his 
								surfaces become, the greater the chance of 
								revelation.<br>
								<br>
								The way such art sparks new levels of awareness 
								is one of life's lasting pleasures. <br>
								<br>
								There's nothing like renewed awareness, the 
								experience of waking up to beauty and mystery 
								right in front of you moment-to-moment, to 
								seeing anew.<br>
