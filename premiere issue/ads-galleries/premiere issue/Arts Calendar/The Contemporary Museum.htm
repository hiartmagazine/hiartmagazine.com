<p><font face="Arial">TCM is pleased to present the The Contemporary Museum 
Ninth Biennial of Hawai‘i Artists, one of TCM’s most popular exhibitions. The 
invitational Biennial, inaugurated in 1993, was developed to serve as a 
complement to Hawai‘i’s numerous juried exhibitions, offering artists the 
opportunity to exhibit a new body of work or installation in one of TCM’s 
galleries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Biennial is organized by Inger Tully, Curator of 
Exhibitions. An illustrated exhibition catalogue, containing an essay on each 
artist by Marcia Morse, professor of art, writer, and artist, will be available 
for purchase in the Museum Shop. The Biennial exhibitions and catalogues provide 
an ongoing survey of the remarkable range of contemporary art being created in 
Hawai‘i today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Seven artists were selected to participate in the Biennial

Janetta Napp</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Dividing her time between Berlin and Honolulu, artist 
Janetta Napp notes, “All in all, by staying in zones in-between countries and 
cultures, painting and drawing, the tangible and invisible, the personal and the 
anonymous, I search for some sort of truth that I only seem to near in the areas 
less defined.” Napp’s recent series documenting her fascination with 
microbiology and classification and her ongoing ballpoint pen sketches, which 
illuminate her daily thoughts, are the subjects of this exhibition of drawings, 
sculptures, and paintings.</font></p>

New Paintings Lynne Gilroy</h4>
</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial">Intrigued with capturing the subtle variations of light 
over time, Maui artist Lynne Gilroy spent three years creating her newest series 
of mixed-media works on panel. This careful study of the horizon, where air 
meets water, led to works that range from comparative landscapes to abstracted 
lines of color. The exhibition includes works titled, Colored Pairs, bright 
monochromes coupled with patterned black panels, inspired by the refractions of 
light under water and overwhelmingly magenta sunsets. The artist notes, “In the 
end, the subject moved from the horizon to pure light and became completely open 
to interpretation.”&nbsp; <i>click image for larger view.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Comprised of a remarkably diverse range of media: glass, 
wood, found objects, and fiber, Woven Vessels features the works of eight 
innovative artists who consistently push the boundaries of the age-old craft of 
weaving. Sharing similar processes and technical attributes, the dynamic 
media—skillfully manipulated by each artist—celebrates the many forms of the 
“vessel” and presents an evocative look at the evolving boundaries between 
functional and sculptural art. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Showcasing the ancient and limitless “vessel” shape as it 
is created through the universal technique of weaving, this exhibition provides 
an examination of fundamental design elements—space, line, balance, color, 
shape, texture, form and value—to highlight the “re-invention” of timeless 
concepts and aesthetic themes.</font></p>

									So. Fresh.&nbsp; ConTempo’s enduring legacy year 
									after year is that it’s not your every-day, 
									run-of-the-mill, just-above-average museum 
									fundraiser.&nbsp; When the committee forms each 
									time, all bets are off.&nbsp; They begin anew to 
									re-invent, re-package, and re—invigorate The 
									Contemporary Museum’s only major fundraiser. 
									In a nutshell, that’s the success of 
									ConTempo and why it’s often the most 
									talked-about party of the year. It never 
									goes stale. Just like the modern art the 
									event supports, ConTempo is always a fresh, 
									out-of-the-box experience.</p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%" class="MsoNormal">
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If the guests don’t go home 
									saying, “O what a night!” then we haven’t 
									done our job,” says Cherye Pierce who is 
									chairing the 2011 event yet again after a 
									most successful 2008 event that defied all 
									fundraising expectations--even in light of 
									the worst stock market disaster in most of 
									our collective memories. </p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									&nbsp;“ To say she’s a legend in her own time, is 
									probably an understatement,” says TCM’s 
									Executive Director Allison Wong.&nbsp; “We’re 
									delighted she has such a passion for art, 
									for community service, and for ConTempo.&nbsp; It 
									was Cherye Pierce who chaired the very first 
									ConTempo nearly two decades ago.”</p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									&nbsp;How does she do it?&nbsp; At a recent breakfast 
									meeting hosted by Neiman Marcus, where the 
									Preview Party will once again be held the 
									evening of Tuesday, April 5, Cherye Pierce 
									assembled a collection of fundraising<i> 
									passionistas</i><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal"> 
									that cross a broad spectrum of Honolulu 
									society, from artists like Diane Chen-KW, to 
									graphic designers like Allison Higa, to 
									small business entrepreneurs like MuuMuus 
									From Heaven’s Deb Mascia, to legendary 
									fundraising arm-twisters and socialites like 
									Sharon Twigg-Smith and Violet Loo.&nbsp; There 
									are even a few “men of style” on the 
									committee like retired museum professional 
									Tim Choy, Neiman Marcus’ Paul Tomonari, and 
									TCM’s own Gordon Wong. If it’s one thing 
									Pierce knows how to do, it’s how to pick a 
									peck of party people.&nbsp; Say that fast three 
									times.</span></p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									Another key to Pierce’s success is location, 
									location, location.&nbsp; The 2011 event will be 
									held Saturday, April 16, at Waikiki’s newest 
									modern tropical paradise, Marriott’s The 
									Waikiki EDITION hotel on Ala Moana 
									Boulevard. Think where great design meets 
									innovation and toss in a collection of 
									creative contemporary art for auction and 
									you see where the buzz is going.&nbsp; By April, 
									the hotel should be just hitting its stride 
									after its October 2010 grand opening to rave 
									reviews.</p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									The Waikiki EDITION is Marriott’s new line 
									of lifestyle home-tels, mixing good design 
									with the comforts of home (like imported 
									linens by Frette, and bathrooms with 
									over-sized glass-enclosed showers and 
									Terrazzo countertops) and innovative new 
									features like an outdoor movie theatre, spa, 
									and ocean views. (Room, anyone?)&nbsp; </p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									This year the committee is reaching out to 
									the young, the hip, and the passionate for 
									art, enticing a new generation of patrons to 
									reserve their seats and take their place on 
									the RSVP list of people who like to party 
									with style.&nbsp; They are also reaching out for 
									one-of-a-kind auction items and will be 
									inviting a hand-picked selection of 
									internationally-known artists to submit 
									artwork for bidding. Some of the names being 
									dropped include Deborah Butterfield (known 
									for her fabulous life-size horse sculptures) 
									And we can list other artists here; </p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									It’s not even Christmas yet and already 
									ConTempo 2011 is shaping up pretty fine.&nbsp; 
									All that’s left, beside a thousand details 
									to finagle, are for those generous eager 
									beavers to step up and buy those hot-ticket 
									premium tables before they all get taken. 
									Ticket sales won’t be starting for another 
									few months, but you can reserve an 
									invitation or a premium table by emailing 
									Gordon Wong at
									<a title="This external link will open in a new window" target="_blank" href="http://emailmg.ipower.com/sqmail/src/compose.php?send_to=contempo2011@tcmhi.org">
									contempo2011@tcmhi.org</a>.&nbsp; Individual 
									tickets will be the same price as last year, 
									$500 per person. Premium tables start at 
									$5000, but the sky’s the limit!</p>
									<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">
									Proceeds from ConTempo support a myriad of 
									programs at The Contemporary Museum 
									including exhibitions, children’s art 
									activities, and the care of the beautiful 
									gardens and historic homes at its 
									top-of-the-hill residential location in 
									Makiki Heights.&nbsp; The Contemporary Museum 
									celebrated 22 years in October and is 
									Hawaii’s only museum dedicated to presenting 
									the art of today by the famous artists of 
									tomorrow. For more information, visit the
