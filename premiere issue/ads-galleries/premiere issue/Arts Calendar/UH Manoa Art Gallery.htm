														The University of Hawaii 
														Art Gallery in 
														collaboration with the 
														University of Hawaii 
														Library presents work by 
														celebrated, prolific 
														American author and 
														artist Edward Gorey 
														(1925-2000), revered for 
														his distinctly elegant, 
														enigmatic, and eerie 
														black and white 
														illustrations. This 
														exhibition features over 
														700 books, book jackets, 
														prints, posters, 
														original drawings, 
														postcards, handmade 
														dolls, and other 
														ephemera from the John 
														A. Carollo - Edward 
														Gorey Collection in the 
														University of Hawaii at 
														Manoa Library's Special 
														Research Collections, 
														with special loans

														Edward Gorey House, 
														Yarmouth Port, 
														Massachusetts.</font></div>
													<div>
														<font color="#000000" face="Arial">
														<br>
														Through poetical prose 
														and short narratives 
														with obsessively 
														crosshatched drawings, 
														Gorey invented a gothic 
														world of 
														Victorian/Edwardian 
														interiors and remote 
														landscapes with 
														stylishly dressed 
														characters entangled in 
														provocative and humorous 
														tales of mystery, peril, 
														and bizarre twists of 
														fate. His mischievous 
														children, incredible 
														creatures, and 
														nonsensical plots and 
														parody amuse and delight 
														readers around the 
														world.<br>

													<div>
														<font color="#000000" face="Arial">
														This exhibition honors 
														Edward Gorey who left a 
														legacy of over one 
														hundred authored books 
														and more than 80 books 
														that he illustrated for 
														others. His devotion 
														towards literary works, 
														cinema, George 
														Balanchine's New York 
														City Ballet, and to 
														animals and his cats is 
														legendary. Gorey's 
														influence is 
														international with his 
														works translated in 15 
														languages. His words and 
														images have inspired 
														many writers, visual 
														artists, musicians, and 
														filmmakers to create 
														compositions, 
														interpretive theatrical 
														productions, graphic 
														design, and animations.</font></div>

														Edward Gorey was 
														inspired by the vast 
														range of books and films 
														that he voraciously 
														consumed from silent 
														classics, mystery, 
														thrillers, and pop 
														culture. The films 
														selected include his 
														favorites such as Louis 
														Feuillade's<i> Les 
														Vampires</i> and<i> 
														Alfred Hitchcock's The 
														Lady Vanishes.</i> 
														Others were selected for 
														similarities that can be 
														seen in the characters, 
														stories, and dark humor. 
														Each film is preceded by 
														a short educational 
														presentation.<br><br>
