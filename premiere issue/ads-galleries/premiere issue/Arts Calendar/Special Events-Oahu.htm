7:00 – 9:00. In-between: New Works by Janetta Napp: Dividing her time between 
Berlin and Honolulu, artist Janetta Napp notes, “All in all, by staying in zones 
in-between countries and cultures, painting and drawing, the tangible and 
invisible, the personal and the anonymous, I search for some sort of truth that 
I only seem to near in the areas less defined.” Napp’s recent series documenting 
her fascination with microbiology and classification and her ongoing ballpoint 
pen sketches, which illuminate her daily thoughts, are the subjects of this 
exhibition of drawings, sculptures, and paintings. Horizon: New Paintings Lynne 
Gilroy: Intrigued with capturing the subtle variations of light over time, Maui 
artist Lynne Gilroy spent three years creating her newest series of mixed-media 
works on panel. This careful study of the horizon, where air meets water, led to 
works that range from comparative landscapes to abstracted lines of color. The 
exhibition includes works titled, Colored Pairs, bright monochromes coupled with 
patterned black panels, inspired by the refractions of light under water and 
overwhelmingly magenta sunsets. The artist notes, “In the end, the subject moved 
from the horizon to pure light and became completely open to interpretation.” 
Woven Vessels: Featuring Works by Bernice Akamine, Pam Barton, Mark Chai, Scott 
Fitzel, Mika McCann, Michael and Misato Mortara, and Gail Toma: Comprised of a 
remarkably diverse range of media: glass, wood, found objects, and fiber, Woven 
Vessels features the works of eight innovative artists who consistently push the 
boundaries of the age-old craft of weaving. Sharing similar processes and 
technical attributes, the dynamic media—skillfully manipulated by each 
artist—celebrates the many forms of the “vessel” and presents an evocative look 
at the evolving boundaries between functional and sculptural art. Showcasing the 
ancient and limitless “vessel” shape as it is created through the universal 
technique of weaving, this exhibition provides an examination of fundamental 
design elements—space, line, balance, color, shape, texture, form and value—to 
highlight the “re-invention” of timeless concepts and aesthetic themes.</span>

		- thirtyninehotel announces the fourth installment of its 39 Chambers 
		Artist Residency Program (39 CARP). Los Angeles, California to Manila, 
		Philippines : You Are My Blindspot (Part 1) Gina Osterloh presents 
		photographic works and a new light installation that question how we as 
		individuals define ourselves in relationship to the physical and 
		psychological room that surrounds us, groups of individuals, and larger 
		forces such as landscape and nationhood. Through still performances with 
		anonymous sitters, cast papier-mâché mannequins, and cardboard cutouts 
		in room-size constructed paper sets, Gina Osterloh’s photographs present 
		an inherent focus problem in the structure of seeing. &nbsp;In each 
		photograph, the structure of the thin paper room acts as a stand-in for 
		perception and language. In many photographs, the masking of a face and 
		the body itself, acts as a point of rupture, or blank, in the picture 
		plane. Osterloh has carefully considered the space and culture of 
		thirtyninehotel, as well as the geographic location of Hawai’i (between 
		California and the Philippines) to deliver an immersive experience that 
		proposes new ground between a body politic, identity formation, and 
		abstraction. This is Osterloh’s debut Hawai`i exhibition; in 2011 
		components of this show will travel to exhibitions in Manila and Los 
		Angeles.&nbsp;<b><br>
