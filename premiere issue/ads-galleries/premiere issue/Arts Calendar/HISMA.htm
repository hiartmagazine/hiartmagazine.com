				The <i><b>I Love Art Gallery</b></i> helps you learn about the 
				elements of art through hands-on activities.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				An interactive educational gallery that promotes the 
				understanding and appreciation of the arts, and encourages the 
				public to increase their own awareness of the place and 
				significance of art in their own lives.<br>
				<br>
				The gallery allows visitors of all ages to learn together in a 
				refreshing and informal setting. It focuses on the vocabulary 
				and structure of art-making through the elements and principles 
				of art and design (such as line, shape, form, space, and 
				texture); ties information to objects currently on view in our 
				galleries; and provides hands-on activities to experience art 
				materials. Participants are encouraged to learn about art as 
				artists do – by touching, observing, exploring, thinking, and 
				reading.<br>
				<br>
				We encourage you to explore the gallery to share insights and 
				ideas, become familiar with the language of art, and see for 
				yourself how it builds and shapes the works in our galleries.<br>
