							series that drew upon the lore he lived and learned 
							from his full-blooded Hawaiian mother and her 
							extended family. Although I've often been drawn to

						Wailehua utilized a characteristic “cartoon or window” 
						mannerism in many of his works. Thru this device he was 
						able to bridge both space and time bringing each fully 
						formed story to life within a single canvas. “The 
						Office” is one painting I easily recall taking a simple 
						storyline and putting each element into place via a 
						series of such windows. This ability to see beyond each 
						canvas’ dimensional limitations was one of his great 
						strengths. Often these small but vibrant windows would 
						easily slip into the psyche of the viewer without being 
						apparent in any out-of-the-ordinary way. They are 
						frequent but basic elements to most of his overall 
						compositions. Each such portion could be seen and 
						appreciated visually as independent without being 
						separated from the whole. In retrospect, I believe none 
						of these windows, complete as they may have been, would 
						survive outside their intended positions in his finished 
						paintings.</b></font><p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						His involvement with local organizations was heart-felt 
						and keenly demonstrated by works such as his amakua* 
						figure of a solitary hawk sitting atop a tree limb 
						before an undeniable Big Isle landscape: “Ka’io Kea” 
						(The White Hawk). He created and lent this image to Save 
						Hamakua for fund-raising efforts by their fledgling 
						group. *(amakua – Ancestral spirit guardians represented 
						by a host of animals found in Hawaii.) </b></font></td>

						mail was a flyer from the Hamakua Music Festival. 
						Quadruple imprinted images by Wailehua graced this small 
						brochure reminding me (and everyone) once again how much 
						he gave and how much we have lost with his passing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His artistry is something too few people are acquainted 
						with. The answer why is quite complex. Even people who 
						knew him usually didn’t have a clue about the depth of 
						artistic variety he produced. To wit Wailehua’s simple 
						ink drawing (used by the afore-mentioned music festival) 
						which combines a signature (but stylized) petroglyph 
						figure playing a bass viol with the distant moon perched 
						in an upper corner like a stage hung spotlight. He 
						caught within this small granulated image, both the 
						flavor and reasoning behind their festival – funding of 
						a youth scholarship program and providing music teachers 
						for local schools. An accomplished guitarist himself he 
						played with some of the worlds’ finest musicians in his 
						seven plus decades. In deed Wailehua loved making music

						Art, they too have none in their permanent collection.
