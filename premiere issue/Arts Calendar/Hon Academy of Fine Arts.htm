					<h2>Exhibition Overview</h2>
					<p><strong>Featuring the work of</strong></p>

					Nunes • Lucky Olelo • Richie Lucero • Sado • Sua Suluape 
					Toetuu, Aisea • Billy Whitney</p>
					<p>Tattooing is art. After decades of being viewed as a mark 
					of the marginal, tattoos have gone mainstream and are 
					winning over the art establishment—including the Honolulu 
					Museum of Art. The lines between ink on skin and paint on 
					canvas or pencil on paper have been blurred with tattoo 
					artists reaching the skill level of other artists. Now the 
					Honolulu Museum of Art breaks new ground with an exhibition 
					focusing on Hawai‘i’s high quality of tattoo art—and how it 
					sprouted from the islands’ mix of cultures rich with tattoo 
					traditions.</p>
					<p>The museum is in the unique position to draw upon its 
					world-class collection to place contemporary tattooing 
					within an art historical context. By linking the 
					past—through works such as 19th-century prints by Jacques 
					Arago depicting tattooed Hawaiians—with the present, the 
					museum hopes to expand cultural awareness not only about the 
					art of the tattoo, but also the rich cultural traditions it 
					is based on.</p>
					<p>“Most artists believe that the basis of great art is 
					drawing,” says Jost. “And tattoo artists in Hawai‘i are 
					incredible draftsmen. They use this skill to create 
					extraordinary tattoos. Add to that Polynesian, Asian, and 
					military cultures, and the result is that Honolulu is now 
					recognized as one of the world’s tattoo meccas. We are 
					getting this recognition because the artists are great. It 
					is a topic so vast, with so many cultural influences, that 
					the entire museum curatorial staff is working as one team to 
					create this exhibition.”</p>
					<p>Home to the centuries-old Hawaiian kakau tradition, 
					prototypical American tattoo artist Norman “Sailor Jerry” 
					Collins, and the many tattoo traditions found in Japan and 
					throughout Polynesia, Honolulu was destined to develop a 
					corps of sought-after tattoo artists creating a visual 
					language derived from all these cultures.</p>
					<p>The exhibition presents 10 tattoo masters as contemporary 
					artists, revealing their skills, ideas and sensibilities 
					through photographs of the bodies on which they have drawn. 
					We'll reveal the 10 artists in May.</p>
					<p>In addition, the exhibition highlights tattooing’s 
					foundation of rich and diverse cultural traditions found in 
					Hawai‘i today—Hawaiian, American, Japanese and Polynesian 
					cultures will be featured. These smaller, focused galleries 
					will link to works of art that are sources for Hawai‘i’s 
					contemporary tattoo artists. For example, on view will be 
					19th-century Japanese woodblock prints that are the source 
					of many contemporary tattoos. The curators also focus on 
					military and mariner tattoo traditions, 18th-century western 
					drawings depicting Pacific Islanders bearing tattoos, 
					textiles and their rich link to Polynesian tattoos, and the 
					specialized, beautiful tools used by the artists.</p>
					<p>The exhibition reveals that the museum itself plays a 
					part in tattoo culture—Japanese iconography tattoos created 
					by O‘ahu artists are often based on works that can be found 
					at the Honolulu Museum of Art. “At one Honolulu tattoo 
					studio, we saw on a shelf books used as visual references 
					and design inspiration—and they included the museum’s 
					catalogue of Japanese prints from the Lane Collection. The 
					tattooists didn’t even know that the original art was less 
					than 10 blocks away,” says Jost.</p>
					<p>“Because tattooing has not been considered part of the 
					art historical canon,” says Jost, “the museum staff worked 
					with many local experts and artists to understand the 
					artform and learn firsthand how the apprenticeship system is 
					alive and well in Honolulu, resulting in high-quality art. 
					Our goal is to help these artists receive acclaim.”</p>
					<p>One of those experts is part-time Honolulu resident Don 
					Ed Hardy, who was a student of Sailor Jerry. Although now 
					retired from tattooing, Hardy remains revered as a tattoo 
					artist and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of 
					tattoos.</p>
