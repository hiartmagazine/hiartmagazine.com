SAVE THE DATE SHARE Exhibition Overview <br>
Last year, Gladys Kukana Grace, an accomplished lauhala weaver, received a 
National Endowment for the Arts’ National Heritage Fellowship. The prestigious 
program is designed to recognize and preserve the country's diverse cultural 
heritage, and fellowships go to master folk and traditional artists.<br>
<br>
To honor Aunty Gladys, as she is known, and her influence as a teacher, the 
Academy presents Ulana Me Ka Lokomaika’i: To weave from the goodness within, 
p&#257;pale, or hats, by her and her many dedicated students. <br>
<br>
Aunty Gladys learned the art of lauhala weaving from her maternal grandmother, 
Kukana, while growing up in the small town of Olelomoana on Hawai‘i Island’s 
South Kona coast. Weavers claim the hala, or pandanus, trees from that region 
produce the best lauhala (leaf used for weaving). The weaving techniques and 
patterns were once guarded as family secrets, and were handed down from mother 
to daughter. Aunty Gladys’s grandmother’s family was known in particular for 
weaving hats of light and dark contrasting patterns known as anoni.<br>
<br>
Aunty Gladys explains best the value of lauhala: “It is a connection with the 
past. It changes your life. It will make you a better person.” A steward of 
lauhala weaving for more than 30 years, Aunty Gladys has taught hundreds of 
students since the 1980s. She gave many lessons on her front porch. Between 1988 
and 1998, Aunty Gladys also participated in the State Foundation on Culture and 
the Arts' Folk Arts Apprenticeship program.<br>
<br>
In 1997, Aunty Gladys and fellow weaver Frank Masagatani formed Ulana me ka 
lokomaika’i. Today, the weaving club’s annual workshop for new students has a 
two-year waiting list. Aunty Gladys’s former students are now teachers who also 
perpetuate this time-honored art form. Her legacy will live on through their 
passion and devotion.<br>
