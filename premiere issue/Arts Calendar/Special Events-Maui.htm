&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_22">The Annual Maui Open 
						Studios Event is the first of its kind in the state of 
						Hawaii. It follows a model that has been very successful 
						on the mainland for decades, where artists and artisans 
						open up their studios and exhibition spaces to show and 
						sell their work to the public as well as “talk story”, 
						connect, and inspire visitors. Many artists also give 
						live demonstrations of their process and techniques. The 
						entire event is free to the public. The inaugural event 
						in 2011 was a huge success with 111 participating 
						artists and over 6,000 individual studio visits by art 
						collectors and art enthusiasts. The 2<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_21">nd</span> 
						Annual Maui Open Studios Event is scheduled for all four 
						weekends of February 2012 and will feature over 100 
						artists, many of which are joining us for the first 
						time. The 2012 artist roster includes painters, 
						furniture designers, glass artists, ceramicists, stone 
						carvers, photographers, feather artists, wood carvers, 
						sculptors, print makers, jewelry designers, 
						watercolorists and much more, all inspired by the 
						creative energy of Maui.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_20"><br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_22">Visitors are invited to 
						meet many of the participating artists at the Opening 
						Celebration/Preview Exhibition, where they can enjoy a 
						cash bar, no-host pupus, listen to live music, preview 
						one or two pieces of the artists' work, and pick up a 
						copy of the MOS Guidebook containing an artist directory 
						and maps directing them to different studios and 
						exhibition spaces around the island. Guidebooks will 
						also be available throughout the duration of the event 
						at various retail pickup locations around the island, 
						including Gallery Oceanica on Front Street, all four 
						Maui Hands locations, and the Hui No’eau Visual Arts 
						Center. Visitors then design their own self-guided 
						tours, either by referring to their printed Guidebook or 
						through our online artist directory and online digital 
						Guidebook on our website, based on the artists and work 
						that most interests them.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_20"><br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_22">The event is produced and 
						organized by acclaimed fine art photo collage artist and 
						former art gallery owner on Maui and Oahu, Carolyn Quan. 
						She is now based in the San Francisco Bay Area after 
						living in Hawaii for 9 years, while continually 
						remaining connected to the islands and the Hawaiian art 
						community.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_20"><br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_23">“When I moved to the San 
						Francisco Bay Area from Hawaii and began to do research 
						into art shows and ways of exposing my own artwork to 
						the public, I learned about the myriad of open studio 
						events that take place in California and other 
						art-loving states on the mainland. I realized that it 
						was time for Hawaii to have such an event. It is a 
						concept that has been around for almost 40 years on the 
						mainland and it is a wonderful way for artists and 
						artisans to connect with art buyers, collectors and art 
						and craft enthusiasts. It's a chance for the art 
						community to come together and show the world what we've 
						got here on Maui and what we're all about!&quot; says Quan.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_22"><br>

&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_22">The event spans over all 
						four weekends in February to allow the public time to 
						enjoy as many studios as possible, and to give more 
						tourists an opportunity to catch at least one weekend 
						event during their visit to Maui. The Hui No'eau Visual 
						Arts Center in Makawao is a major sponsor of the event 
						and will host demonstrations in their print making, 
						jewelry and ceramic studios on Weekend 2, as well as 
						host a number of independent artists' open studios on 
						their beautiful garden estate property.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_20"><br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_22">Visitors will enjoy a wide 
						range of fine art and fine craft selections as they 
						customize their studio tours and decide which artists’ 
						work will become part of their collections.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_20"><br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
						<p class="paragraph_style_23">&quot;Maui is a major art 
						collectors travel destination. People come from far and 
						wide to purchase art on Maui and add to their 
						collections. I have no doubt that this event will 
						continue to significantly enhance the vibrant and 
						stimulating arts community on Maui. There is so much 
						diverse talent on the island. And since this is an 
						annual event it will attract more art lovers and art 
						collectors to the island year after year, and perhaps 
						even be the focus of visitors' trips to the island 
						whether inter-island, domestic or international. This 
						event allows artists to connect with their art buyers 
						more personally, giving locals and tourists alike a 
						unique experience and opportunity to learn about the 
						artists' techniques and about the artists themselves, as 
						well as purchase art directly from them. The Maui Open 
						Studios event is also a way of helping artists gain 
						vital exposure to the public year after year in a fun, 
						exciting and creative way,&quot; says Quan.<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18px" class="style_22"><br>

<p>On June 4, Haleakal&#257; National Park will host its first Artist in Residence. 
Natalie Westbrook is a print-maker, painter, and collage artist from New Haven, 
Connecticut. Several events are planned to showcase her work. </p>
<p>In 2009, Westbrook received a grant to create new works inspired by Maui and 
Kauai’s National Tropical Botanical Gardens during her graduate art studies. 
Thus began a profound relationship to the natural world which continues today in 
her bright, bold paintings and collages. Westbrook has exhibited her abstract 
and figurative work in Los Angeles and New York City. She teaches art at Yale 
University. </p>
<p>Westbrook is the park’s first Artist in Residence and was selected by a jury 
panel comprised of National Park Service and Maui Arts and Cultural Center 
representatives. The applicants included musicians, sculptors, and painters. “We 
are excited to see what Natalie creates during her two weeks in the park. She 
offers us a fresh artistic perspective on a beloved place, as well as an 
opportunity to share her diverse talents with our student interns and visitors,” 
said Melissa Chimera, Volunteer Coordinator. </p>
<p>The artist will create a new series based on the island’s unique and rare 
flora, such as the `&#257;hinahina, the Haleakal&#257; silversword found only on east 
Maui. She will donate an original artwork to Haleakal</font><font FACE="HNPSRawlinson" SIZE="2">&#257;</font><font FACE="NPSRawlinson" SIZE="3">
