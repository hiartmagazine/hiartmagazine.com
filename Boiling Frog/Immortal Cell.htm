		Budding. What an appealing notion! We think of Life and Death as 
		guardians of<br>
		two doors to the same room—but just a minute—imagine this:<br>
		<br>
		You are the first single-celled organism on the planet. All the 
		information of life on earth is contained within that tiny blob of DNA 
		which constitutes your nucleus, complete information about life in its 
		germinal form. Mitosis—the splitting of that DNA into two nearly 
		identical halves—constitutes the entirety of your sex life. At first 
		this may seem unfulfilling but consider the advantages.<br>
		<br>
		You’ve just had your first single-celled child. Who is the mother and 
		who the baby?<br>
		<br>
		There is no parent cell and there is no progeny. We now have two 
		single-celled organisms. You are at least one of them. And so far you’re 
		not aging badly either; there’s no retirement village in your immediate 
		future.<br>
		<br>
		Generations pass and you reproduce geometrically. There are, perhaps 256 
		of you by now with still no hint of an older or younger cell. Barring 
		natural disaster, most of you is / are still alive.<br>
		<br>
		Now pass a few million years: you’re swimming through the waves just off 
		the California coast. Given a worst case scenario of attrition due to 
		predators, accidental deaths, and even natural disasters, there is! are 
		very likely still billions of you hanging ten off Malibu.<br>
		<br>
		You are potentially immortal!<br>
		<br>
		So where did things go wrong? What was the reward so tantalizing for 
		which nature sacrificed our immortality?<br>
		<br>
		Its origins .lie in those nearly identical halves into which our 
		original cell split through mitosis. Accidental variations in the 
		duplication and division processes (mutations) precipitated the gradual 
		evolution of distinct and varied life forms based on that original, 
		potentially immortal cell.<br>
		<br>
		Over time a new mode for reproduction developed—the big mistake: we 
		traded mitosis for meiosis.<br>
		<br>
		That might not seem so bad at the moment but here’s the down side: While 
		sexual reproduction (meiosis) allows for the joining of two sex cells, 
		each containing approximately half of the genetic information of the 
		parent, facilitating what we now call selective-genetic evolution, it 
		also allows death to enter the equation.<br>
		<br>
		Not accidental death, not death by natural disaster. But death through 
		old age!<br>
		Vessel disposal.<br>
		<br>
		Now there is a certain sort of immortality even in sexual, meiotic 
		reproduction,<br>
		with generation upon generation recombining aspects of genetic heritage 
		to create diversity and specialization. But somehow, the immortality of 
		all the information contained in a sperm or egg seems less meaningful 
		(and less appealing) than the bodily deathlessness of our acellular 
		ancestors.<br>
		<br>
		Viewing the necessary death of the parent organism—ourselves—as the 
		dropping of some vestigial tail, somehow stretches the aesthetic limits 
		of the reasonable.<br>
		<br>
		So why did this happen? Why did nature open this hole through which we 
		must be flushed from life?<br>
		<br>
		Death for sex: was it worth it?<br>
