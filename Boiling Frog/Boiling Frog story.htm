		There they sat sipping drinks—poised between eras—Mouse and Frog, 
		representatives of their respective phyla, experiencing an epiphany, a 
		moment beyond moments when all things are revealed.<br>
		<br>
		Mouse stretched back in the hottub. ‘Yes, I’m afraid it’s the way of the 
		dinosaur for your kind,” he quipped, groping for the temperature 
		control. The water was<br>
		becoming tepid for the warm-blooded mammal, so while Frog considered his 
		comment, Mouse cranked the temperature up another ten degrees and 
		settled himself, comforting his Piña Colada.<br>
		<br>
		As the temperature rose, Frog’s eyelids drooped and his great head 
		nodded precariously toward the bubbling water. But the notion that a 
		primitive limbic system in some way placed his species in line for 
		extinction couldn’t go<br>
		unchallenged.</font></td>

		<td height="198" valign="top"><font size="4">‘We amphibians are common 
		ancestor to both the dinosaur and to you mammals,” he rejoined. “To 
		suggest identical sequelae to our thoroughly divergent evolutionary 
		paths would be more than presumptuous, it would be in poor taste! 
		Frankly I find the idea rather ‘cold-blooded’,” he mused, chuckling at 
		his own pun.<br>
		<br>
		Mouse, however was unrelenting. “Actually, biological history points out 
		that of the cold-blooded genera of 200 million years ago, fully 99% have 
		left no surviving descendent. The inability to adapt to a changing 
		dimate will lead inevitably to extinction!”<br>
		<br>
		But Frog pulled himself easily from the steamy water and, adding ice to 
		his bourbon, commented blithely: “What of you mammals? Overpopulation, 
		interpersonal violence, environmental vandalism! What price the ongoing 
		survival of mammalkind?!”<br>
		<br>
		...and now it was the cold-blooded Mouse who found himself in hot water.</font></td>
