		It was dinnertime as Wolf and his intestinal companion Hookworm sat down 
		to eat And it soon became clear that this wasn’t going to be an entirely 
		comfortable meal for the wolf. For every bite he took, the hookworm took 
		six, which seemed indiscrete and completely inappropriate to Wolf since 
		after all, he was the host.<br>
		<br>
		Dining etiquette! A subject negotiated and loudly discussed ever since 
		amoebas began enveloping bacteria.<br>
		<br>
		“Perhaps I eat a little more voraciously than you,” spouted the hookworm 
		between mouthfuls, “but doesn’t that just make me more fit to survive? 
		Competition is—pardon the expression—the lifeblood of evolution. 
		Survival of the fittest and all that.”<br>
		<br>
		“Ahh, but there are two parameters to survival,” rejoined Wolf, 
		swallowing quickly. “Competition and cooperation. Darwin spoke of 
		‘descent with modification,’ not the dominance of the most aggressive! 
		Don’t you see?”<br>
		<br>
		But Hookworm was blind (like all hookworms), and didn’t see at all. “We 
		parasites are very cooperative!” he insisted. “I begrudge no one a part 
		of my meal. As a matter of fact I’ve invited a few friends over for 
		dinner tomorrow night—no imposition I hope?”<br>
		<br>
		Wolf experienced a very real sinking feeling but continued to make his 
		point. “I have ancestors—now extinct—who hunted for sport,” he 
		sputtered. “They were such successful hunters that they killed off all 
		prey within their ecosystem. Nature despises abuses of that sort!”<br>
		<br>
		Swirling red fluid in his glass, Hookworm downed another mouthful of his 
		host’s best. “Consider the myriad relationships possible within this 
		grand biosphere,” he mused. “Fungi in symbiotic union with algae form 
		lichen; or the commensal situation where a whale might unknowingly help 
		relocate barnacles across an ocean at no cost to himself; or the 
		parasitic arrangement we have here...<br>
		<br>
		“All these relationships are equivalent in the larger picture,” 
		continued the inimical Hookworm. “From the top of the food chain on down 
		to the bottom, every relationship is essentially exploitative. Are you 
		not just a special sort of parasite upon those creatures you hunt, upon 
		others of your own species, even upon your own mother as you grew in her 
		womb? Why deny our nature?!”<br>
		<br>
		But the Wolf countered. “Aren’t all those relationships essentially 
		variations on cooperation also? What of the common ancestor we share 
		with the cooperative bee, or the symbiotic balance achieved by the 
		benign parasites of the digestive tracts? It’s a choice! What we were 
		meant to be versus what we might yet become. Nature versus nurture: it 
		always comes down to that doesn’t it?”<br>
		<br>
		The hookworm was unmoved and just leaned back in his chair, dabbing 
		dinner’s remnants from the corner of his mouth with his white napkin.<br>
		<br>
		Shifting uncomfortably in his chair the distraught wolf scowled. “If 
		nothing else, self-interest should redirect your consideration of our 
		relationship! Eating me into extinction is not only poor manners, it’s 
		unenlightened! A fully realized parasite would not kill its host.”<br>
		<br>
		Hookworm gazed blindly into the distance, commenting vacantly, “Food for 
		thought...” But in truth, the satiated parasite was only thinking of 
		where he might find his next meal.<br>
