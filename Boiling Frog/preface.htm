		Thousands of years of myth and magic collide with a hundred and fifty 
		years of Darwinism. As children we bandied about complex concepts of 
		morality and religion while the implications of evolution remained 
		cloistered in the vaulted minds of balding polysyllabic scientists.<br>
		<br>
		But within these paradigms can be found models of ourselves; clear pools 
		for reflection of our position in time, the world, and our own minds; 
		models for understanding our past, present, and future—how we came to 
		be, who we are, and what we might yet become.<br>
		<br>
		Observations and concepts compiled over the millennia of human 
		observation form the basis of these parables. With perspectives and 
		paradigms borrowed and stolen from human biology, genetics, comparative 
		anatomy, and embryology, I hope to conjure images as palpable as the 
		ghosts and angels of myth, yet as natural as the world we see, touch and 
		feel around us.<br>
