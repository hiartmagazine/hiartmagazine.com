			Man With Five Brains</font><p><font size="4">Socrates couldn’t make 
			up his mind. He gazed down at the cup in his hand, then out the 
			barred window of his cell, to the proscenium across the square where 
			his young protege's gathered. One part of his mind seemed to say, 
			&quot;Get out of here, you idiot!&quot; while another part said to remain 
			quietly in his cell to face his death sentence.</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">WUMP-wump-wump, WUMP-wump-wump-his limbic system 
			sent new information. RUN, RUN it said. But as that information ran 
			from his cerebellum through numerous neural connections to his 
			frontal lobes, his neocortex was processing the obvious hopelessness 
			of such an ad.</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">It occurred to Socrates at that moment, that a 
			good man-a man who was good at being a man-had probably to be good 
			at being a fish also. This possibility had never really suggested 
			itself to Socrates before, in all his dialog with his students, but 
			then this situation was unique and really quite stimulating.</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">Young Plato, with his utopian ideals was always 
			suggesting outlandish ideas like this though. He would have enjoyed 
			this notion: Several loosely connected brains, at work within each 
			man at any given moment...</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">Too bad he'd never get to discuss the idea with 
			him now. In Athens four hundred years before Christ, it had become a 
			capital crime to teach the young to think, even with one brain! But 
			right now Socrates had nothing left but lime so he pursued this new 
			line of thought:</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">How might I have put it?</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">The whole is at least the sum of its parts, is it 
			not? And do we not have numerous impulses in given situations? A man 
			fallen into a pond will thrash about, fish-like, driven by a dormant 
			instinct shared with some aquatic creature, while a person injured 
			in the Street might curl up like a worm...</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">Hence, at any given instance, a man might access a 
			place within himself where he will behave as any one, or group of 
			'lower animals' might act. It follows, that in order to excel as a 
			whole man-that is of course, to be good at being a man-would require 
			being good at being a fish, or perhaps a rodent or deer or a worm.</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">The concept had a certain seditious logic to it 
			and might well catch a rise from the young Creeks. What might the 
			philosophic repercussions be? Would there be ontological 
			ramifications? Or could some moral imperative be sprung from this 
			notion? Would there have to be a place for sea gulls in Plato's new 
			republic?</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">Finally the idea was taking form and Socrates 
			found himself growing thirsty. Swirling the hemlock once in his 
			glass, he swallowed down the fetid mix and lay back to dream the 
			five-brained dreams of good men, while ideas of phylogeny would wait 
			dormant another two thousand years before corrupting the minds of 
			the youth of another time.</font></div>
