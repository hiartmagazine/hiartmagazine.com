			Chicken or the Egg?</font><br>
			<br>
			<font size="4">
			To anyone else it may have seemed like just another poultry 
			question, but to a chicken it was the answer to the penultimate 
			question of his own ontology. And Chicken was the first of his kind 
			to truly know the answer. This is how it happened:<br>
			<br>
			Early one morning a chick hatched. It was his first day and his mind 
			was filled with questions. Looking at the calcified wreckage 
			surrounding him in his grassy nest, he peeped:<br>
			<br>
			“Mother, which came first, me or that shell?”<br>
			<br>
			Mother lifted a wing and clucked with amusement at the kinds of 
			things day-old chicks will ask.<br>
			<br>
			“That’s a <i>First Cause</i>-type question, son!” she replied. 
			“Philosophers have been asking questions like that for thousands of 
			years. Actually the discussion of that question might be the 
			cornerstone of modem Western thought.”<br>
			<br>
			She smiled a toothless maternal smile and chuckled: “Perhaps you’d 
			better wait till you grow feathers to tackle that one.”<br>
			<br>
			But the question seemed clear enough to the young chick and he 
			stumbled, frustrated from the nest, out into the yard to ask his 
			father.<br>
			<br>
			The old rooster sighed philosophically, as fathers often will when 
			children ask difficult questions, and he responded with this story:<br>
			<i><br>
			An old lady approached a physicist regarding the place of the Earth 
			in the Cosmos.<br>
			<br>
			“You scientists think you’re so tricky!” said the old lady. 
			“Everyone knows that the world is resting on the back of a Giant 
			Turtle!”<br>
			<br>
			“If that’s so,” returned the physicist, “then upon what does the 
			Turtle rest?”<br>
			<br>
			But the Old Lady wasn’t to be turned away that easily. “You can’t 
			fool me,” she replied, “It’s Turtles all the way down!”</i><br>
			<br>
			Chick turned away. He hadn’t expected such dogged sophistry from his 
			own father. It was one thing not to know, but quite another to 
			suggest that the unknown and the unknowable might be the same. A 
			notion like that bordered on superstition.<br>
			<br>
			So he carried his question from the yard out into the world asking 
			everyone he met, “Which came first, the Chicken or the Egg?” But he 
			was met with either blank stares or quizzical amusement. The chicken 
			was never sure whether other people just didn’t care or whether he 
			was perhaps the butt of some great social joke.<br>
			<br>
			Chick was schooled traditionally and went on to attend Harvard, 
			completing a doctorate in First Cause Questions. But although 
			discussion of his question was rife, his professors considered 
			discussion itself, and not answers, to be the ultimate goal of 
			Philosophic inquiry.<br>
			<br>
			So the curious chicken entered the priesthood. Religious dogma 
			depended on a leap of faith, offering a First Cause, postulated 
			without a <i>first cause</i>! But that didn’t satisfy even a 
			chicken’s brain so he renounced faith, and as the years passed him by Chick 
			grew despondent.<br>
			<br>
			He became infamous around the barnyard for his cynicism, looking 
			upon all forms of rational inquiry, both religious and sectarian, 
			with equal ironic skepticism. To the horror of family and academic 
			peers, he began frequenting fetid, damp nooks, associating with 
			lower life forms-reptiles and sometimes even amphibians, engaging 
			anyone in debate over any issue of even distant relevance to his 
			ontological question.<br>
			<br>
			The specious savagery of his arguments offered precious little 
			shelter from the degradation Chick felt at his obvious personal 
			failure. Hopelessness began to occlude his reason.<br>
			<br>
			But one day fate found Chick behind the barn, discussing primacy of 
			species with a certain lizard, when he chanced to mouth that 
			now-famous rhetorical question which had reduced him so completely. 
			‘Which came first, the Chicken or the Egg?!” he muttered, dismissing 
			the grim reptile and turning away.<br>
			<br>
			“You don’t need a bifurcated cerebral cortex to figure that one 
			out!” chuckled the Lizard. “A college graduate like yourself knows 
			that reptiles like me preceded birds on Earth by several million 
			years!”<br>
			<br>
			Chick turned back nodding absently, but this lesson in Biology 101 
			hardly seemed apropos.<br>
			<br>
			Lizard stared at the chicken with that awed look that ordinary 
			people have saved for the special stupidity of scholars and priests 
			for thousands of years and he laughed. “A million years before you 
			chickens were laying eggs like this one, we reptiles and amphibians 
			were already hatching them!”</font><font size="6"><br>
