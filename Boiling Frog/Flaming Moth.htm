		<br>
		A glint of flame—a tiny puff of smoke; intermittent tragedy occurs 
		around a blue light on the back porch...<br>
		<br>
		A dull brown feather-winged moth fluttered through caves a million years 
		ago—her ancestors had probably been fluttering that way for millions of 
		years before. The search for safety and sustenance in those nocturnal 
		paleolithic hunting grounds led them to dark shadowy caverns, inhabited 
		by few predators.<br>
		<br>
		But for purposes of procreation, the brown moth found herself drawn by 
		instinct out into the open sunshine among flowers and leaves, taking a 
		chance on becoming an hors d’oeuvre for some voracious bird or reptile.<br>
		<br>
		The instinctive directive that led her from the safety of the caves to 
		that place of vulnerabiity was phototropism: an attraction to light.<br>
		<br>
		There was undoubtedly adequate selective-genetic justification for this 
		tendency: foraging among green leaves and grasses, though dangerous for 
		moths, was surely more survival-adaptive for hungry green caterpillars 
		than scrounging in desolate caverns.<br>
		<br>
		But nature is unforgiving of habits and instincts once adaptive, which 
		are<br>
		maintained beyond their adaptive time. Between the taming of fire by our 
		ancestors, and our final perfection of the bug-zapper, there was 
		insufficient opportunity for a more selectively phototropic moth to 
		evolve.<br>
		<br>
		So nature accepts the loss of those moths whose encounters with light in 
		its<br>
		modern, more deadly forms is terminal, balancing it in some cosmic 
		ledger against the adaptive value of an instilled instinct.<br>
		<br>
		And in the larger picture of time and events the flaming moth becomes an 
		acceptable loss.<br>
