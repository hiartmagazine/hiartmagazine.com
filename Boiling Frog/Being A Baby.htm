		<font size="4"><br>
		Homo sapiens as a species is a relative infant on the planet, taking its 
		first steps on earth (in near enough to present form) about 40,000 years 
		ago. Since departing the mainstream of primate lineage, approximately 10 
		million years earlier, several major adaptations occurred precipitating 
		the development of humans as we know them.<br>
		<br>
		First came bipedality. A small trick you say? A poodle can do it in time 
		to music. True, but can a poodle snap its fingers and tap its foot 
		simultaneously?<br>
		<br>
		While a narrowed, rotated pelvis and a slender, arched hind foot 
		facilitated efficient upright locomotion, the development of an 
		opposable thumb on the forelimb freed primate hands for sophisticated 
		tool use.<br>
		<br>
		But one problem still remained: Not enough brain! We had to figure out 
		what to do with our newly acquired appendages.<br>
		<br>
		That’s a bigger problem than you might first imagine. Think about it: 
		You’re a Neanderthal woman with the relatively narrow pelvic width 
		required for bipedality but you want a child with a big brain, someone 
		who can do more than swing through trees.<br>
		<br>
		You need a child with a big head... Large head, small pelvis: a painful 
		thought!<br>
		<br>
		A newborn horse can rise up onto all fours and trot after its mother. An 
		infant baboon can hang from its mother’s fur while she swings through 
		the jungle using alternate arm locomotion, leaving her nice wide pelvic 
		span to hang comfortably below.<br>
		<br>
		But a human newborn can neither suspend its own head nor roll onto its 
		back without help. The final step in human evolution was (perhaps) 
		premature birth. We had to be born with a head small and undeveloped 
		enough to pass through a narrow pelvic opening.<br>
		<br>
		The price of this development was a small, helpless and extremely 
		vulnerable baby requiring an extraordinary amount of post-natal care, an 
		extended infancy and an extremely long adolescence during which our 
		brains and heads might grow larger. Then finally, an education could 
		fill us with enough culturally transmitted information to make effective 
		use of those bulbous heads.<br>
		<br>
		Before humans, evolution could be characterized in two phases: In the 
		first, the stuff of primordial soup could be described largely in terms 
		of physics and chemistry. In the second, those physico-chemical laws 
		compounded creating living organisms. The laws of selective-genetic 
		evolution governing this second phase describe the development and 
		diversification of species through the information encoded and carried 
		forth on chromosomes through genes.<br>
		<br>
		Although humans today remain subject to physics, chemistry and 
		selective-genetic evolution, we also grow and evolve as a cultural 
		entity, recombining basic laws of genetics and even physics to our will. 
		A new third phase of evolution, where information is carried, not just 
		chemically and genetically, but cerebrally and culturally, characterizes 
		us. A cerebro-cultural evolution with newly compounded laws and entirely 
		new potentials defines our future limitations and possibilities.<br>
		<br>
		If human culture is really an indication of a third level of evolution 
		then perhaps a new entity has come into being on the planet, almost 
		unnoticed. Information is its DNA carried down through culture and 
		individuals are its chromosomes: a gigantic new organism taking its 
		first steps on Earth.<br>
		<br>
		So here it is, Mom! It’s a baby! It’s a boy and a girl—with 10 billion 
		eyes and 50 billion toes. It has a big head but no idea where it’s 
		going.</font><p></td>
