							<p><font face="Arial">An exhibition by HFAC youth in 
							celebration of Earth Day.<br>
							<br>
							We can all learn through the eyes of a child. At 
							HFAC, we are constantly amazed by the creative 
							talents of our young artists as they share their 
							work and experiences about the world in which we 
							live. This exhibition centers around the theme of 
							collaborating with nature and addresses the 
							environment with local and global perspectives. DMAC 
							youth instructors Gerald Lucena, Miho Morinoue, Tomo 
							Nakazato, Janny Pruden, and Yarrow Lutz (NYC) along 
							with their students work together to actively 
							construct a rich understanding of our world through 
							the creative process and strive to create a fun, 
							safe, and inspiring working environment that 
							observes our community, in all its diverse richness, 
							as an extension of the classroom/studio. A silent 
							auction will be held during the exhibition with 
							proceeds helping to support our youth programs. 
							Children's art need not be confined to a 
							refrigerator door, come celebrate the arts in your 
							community with style. The pot-luck opening reception 
							is free to the public.</font></div>

							<br>
							An annual showcase of HFAC's teaching staff, guest, 
							and resident artists. Each artist will show works 
							from his or her current studio investigations. In 
							conjunction with the reception, we will be holding 
							an 'auctionette' featuring the works of our emerging 
							and established artists at great prices and all 
							proceeds benefit DMAC Programs. For art students, 
							seeing instructors' professional work affords an 
							understanding of the ways in which classroom 
							activities are directly linked to creative practice. 
							For the rest of the community, the group show 
							provides access to work that is produced here but 
							most often seen elsewhere, nationally and 
							internationally.</font></div>
