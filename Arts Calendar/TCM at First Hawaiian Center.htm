<p><font face="Arial"><b><u>March 12 through June 18, 2010</u> - The 
Contemporary Museum at First Hawaiian Center</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This exhibition is a memorial tribute to Kauai-born artist 
Ray Yoshida, who died in Honolulu in January 2009. The exhibition will comprise 
work from public and private collections in Hawaii, as well as many works from 
the artist's estate, many of which have not been exhibited previously. Yoshida, 
who taught art for four decades at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 
is known for his mysteriously comical, semi-abstract paintings and collages. 
James Jensen, Deputy Director for Collections and Exhibitions at TCM will curate 
this presentation.</font></p>
