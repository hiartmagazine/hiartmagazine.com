						explosive, ever changing yet frightfully static, the 
						present age lays claim to being the most revolutionary 
						in the history of mankind. The potential for 
						enlightenment and technological and social utopia 
						coexist with an undeniable limitation – poverty, both 
						physical and mental – which reduces the human being to 
						an impotent and insignificant statistic. This indeed is 
						our world, not in the mind but in reality.<br>
						<br>
						Music and the arts in general attest to this: not only 
						are they vehicles for expressing this reality but also 
						their very fabric reflects it. Even the terms artist, 
						craftsman, businessman, amateur, popular and &quot;high&quot; 
						culture, valuable and worthless, successful, hit, 
						masterpiece, original and fake no longer signify the 
						coherence and unity of the reality that was once taken 
						for granted; all of these terms are now interchangeable 
						according to the rules of a particular world. <br>
						<br>
						While serialism has found its ideology and justification 
						in blending with science, the minimalist movement finds 
						its credo in liberation of the individual through 
						impersonal ritual and through deconstructed ethnic 
						music. Popular music, on the other hand, because of its 
						easy marketability through the media, has come to be 
						based entirely on formula and on satisfying the lowest 
						common denominator. These two extremes – elitist 
						(quasi-scientific) contemporary music and mass-produced, 
						formulabased pop and rock muzak – both show the same 
						symptoms: alienation, narrow or &quot;tunnel&quot; vision, and the 
						hypertrophy of one level of consciousness at the expense 
						of others. The result is a caricature of human 
						fragmentation – brain with no body, body with no brain – 
						the isolated self as opposed to the collective with no 
						individual identity, and so on.</font></td>

						original syncretic form was a part of tribal life, 
						integrated into the whole, and the musician’s function 
						was clearly defined by ritual and custom. The musician, 
						as soothsayer, prophet, and supernatural being, was able 
						to communicate the psychical, the divine, to bring 
						people together on the collective, unconscious level. 
						His role, like the shaman’s, was as the catalyst for a 
						profound experience of collective reconnection with the 
						oneness of being. In other words, music had the same 
						function as religion (from lat. religare, to tie back).<br>
						<br>
						This tribal or magical structure of consciousness was 
						emotive, instinctual, characterized by the sense of 
						timelessness and spacelessness. The individual and the 
						group were governed by social customs and laws that did 
						not leave much freedom of choice or room for a highly 
						differentiated sense of self. The performer-improviser 
						worked within orally transmitted archetypal musical 
						forms, based on elaborate systems of patterns. Musically 
						speaking, the emphasis was on rhythm, cyclical form 
						(derived from natural periodicity), pentatonic and 
						mode-based melody.</font></td>

						<font face="Arial">Ancient Greece brought forth social hierarchization and 
						extreme economic polarity, in which the musician became 
						an outcast, untouchable, but paradoxically retained his 
						supernatural role in ritual and religion. At this point 
						in history, the hero myth prevailed and indicated the 
						birth of an independent ego against the background of 
						the collective unconscious. At the same time, because of 
						music’s appeal to the magical in man, the priestly and 
						ruling casts relied strongly on music, which became a 
						permanent fixture in religious ritual.<br>
						<br>
						Thus, as social differentiation progressed, music 
						fractured into sacred and secular. The two faces of 
						music were created: the Apollonian, always in search of 
						balance and harmony, resulting in a long line of 
						aesthetic development – from the Pythagorean music of 
						the spheres to Bach’s crystallization of the tonal 
						system and polyphonic forms to the dream of total 
						serialism in the post-Webern period – but also serving 
						as a psychological pacifier allied with existing power 
						structures; and the Dionysian, subversive, relying on 
						the elemental strength of folk and popular idioms, 
						seeking to express the violence and frustration of the 
						oppressed (from Dionysian ecstatic cults in Greece and 
						Rome to the eruption of popular music in contemporary 
						blues, jazz, and rock).<br>
						<br>
						The music of the Middle Ages was still a blend of sacred 
						and secular music. The jongleur was a vagabond, equally 
						comfortable at village festivities and in court; it 
						would take further social differentiation (in the 
						fourteenth century) to distinguish his role as either 
						court or street musician. Yet before this time there was 
						no specialization. The musician was a generalist: 
						performer, improviser, and composer in one. With the 
						advent of notation and an increasing use of instrumental 
						groups in both church and court, the distancing and 
						isolation of a musical elite took place hand in hand 
						with other developments.</font></td>

						<font face="Arial">The Renaissance, which perhaps is paralleled only by the 
						present in its revolutionary sentiment, marked a 
						divisive line between non perspectival and perspectival 
						structures of consciousness. The discovery of 
						perspective not only led the visual arts to a new 
						understanding and perception of reality but indicated a 
						fundamental mutation in all aspects of the psychosocial 
						fabric. The emphasis was on the rational rather than on

						In music, the refinement and static quality of the modal

						freedom, found in the late fourteenth and fifteenth 
						centuries, became focused and coherently stylized during 
						the Renaissance of the sixteenth century. The 
						idiosyncrasies of particular modes were sacrificed to 
						produce a more uniform major-minor system: a scale 
						became a model to be transposed onto any degree of a 
						semitone-divided octave. Thus, a coherent hierarchical 
						system was established simultaneously with the mutation 
						of consciousness from mythical to rational. At this 
						point, the musician became a domestique, a paid servant 
						with a fixed position in the feudal court. Even though 
						the connections between court and popular music did not 
						dissolve completely, the role of musicians in each 
						became distinctly different: minstrels remained 
						musicians of the street, drawing their inspiration from

						<font face="Arial">In the Baroque period, the musician was primarily a 
						craftsman; his ties to folk and popular music are seen 
						in his improvisational practices, in his double role of 
						performer and composer, and in his lack of social 
						luster. The contrapuntal and harmonic rules were 
						observed (with rare exceptions), and the formal 
						structure reflected, in its cohesion and balance, the 
						monolithic buildings of religious and social 
						institutions. With the advent of the printing press and 
						an increasing reliance on written rather than on 
						improvised music, the roles of interpreter and composer 
						became differentiated, and a road to narrow 
						specialization was paved.<br>
						<br>
						The downfall of feudalism and the takeover of economic 
						and social power by the bourgeoisie brought countless 
						transformations in every aspect of musical life. The 
						court palace, for example, was replaced by the concert 
						hall, thus abandoning the intimacy of the chamber music 
						setting for the monumentality of symphonic music. 
						Whereas chamber music in the feudal setting represented 
						the sheltered subjectivity of an elect few, the concert 
						hall symphony proclaimed the newly acquired power of the 
						bourgeoisie, in which the previously hidden individual 
						suddenly became the focus.<br>
						<br>
						The building of concert halls as unique places of 
						musical representation had a twofold effect: the 
						separation of the musician and musical experience from 
						everyday life and the growing perception of music as a 
						valuable object to be sold. Whereas in the feudal system 
						the musicianservant sold his services exclusively to a 
						master, in early capitalism he became an independent 
						agent, selling his work to various clients. Between 
						being integrated into the totality of tribal life and 
						being given an autonomous, isolated position in the 
						bourgeois system, there is a chasm, and both music and 
						musicians reflect this. The ensuing monologue in music 
						up to the twentieth century spoke of that emancipation 
						and autonomous development on the one hand and of 
						increasing alienation and social dysfunctionality on the 
						other. The final stage of this line of development is 
						familiar: music written and listened to by musicians in 
						empty concert halls.<br>
						<br>
						The new formal archetypes of Classical and Romantic 
						music were based on the psychosocial transformations of 
						preceding periods: the formal growth of polyphonic 
						architecture through the development of one musical 
						thought (the fugue) was replaced by confrontation of 
						contrasting thoughts (the sonata). The Baroque 
						aesthetics of &quot;self-generating&quot; form based primarily on 
						the seamless development of one or more interrelated 
						motifs (a line that can be traced from the Renaissance 
						ricercar, to fugue, to monothematic Haydn sonatas, to 
						the twentieth-century serial and to some extent 
						minimalist forms) was transformed through increasingly 
						polarized harmonic and melodic material, as in the 
						treatment of the sonata by Beethoven and by composers of 
						the Romantic period. This form, in contrast to Baroque 
						polyphonic form, relied on the contrast, confrontation, 
						and dramatic resolution of the dialectic inherent in the 
						material.<br>
						<br>
						As the music (and musician) lost its integration with 
						the totality of social life (as in ritual, ceremony, and 
						festival), it assumed a new autonomous and 
						multifunctional role. Because of the individual 
						composer’s increasing freedom from the formal archetype, 
						music became, potentially, an exposed privacy and 
						therefore a psychosocial way of emphasizing one’s ego 
						identity to an extent never dreamed of in previous 
						periods. If the older forms and styles gave the 
						individual the status of a participant in the universal, 
						the newer gave him the status of the universal itself. 
						In other words, the individual had the power to recreate 
						the world.</font></td>

						<img border="0" src="mendelssohn-03.jpg" width="219" height="360" align="right">While the musician-shaman and musician-servant had to 
						assume rigid social roles and accept aesthetic 
						postulates, the increasingly independent musician of the 
						Classical, Romantic, and contemporary periods became the 
						center and focus of artistic social life: the expression 
						of creative and personal idiosyncrasies not only became 
						possible but was an essential ingredient of this new 
						role. <br>
						<br>
						The birth of the &quot;star,&quot; with all its economic and 
						psychosocial implications, can be traced to the 
						mid–nineteenth century. Two events were of fundamental 
						importance: in 1830 Liszt played compositions of other 
						composers in concert, thereby giving the music repertory 
						a spatial dimension; and in 1829 Mendelssohn performed 
						the St. Matthew’s Passion by Bach, thereby giving the 
						repertory a temporal dimension. These events caused an 
						aesthetic and economic upheaval: the separate functions 
						of the interpreter and the composer became firmly 
						established; an expanded musical universe was created 
						that included music from various regions and times.<br>
						<br>
						Economically speaking, a completely new market of 
						clients interested in music from the past was created, 
						transforming both the &quot;star&quot; and the music into a 
						valuable object akin to capital stock. The classical 
						music market today is a direct outcome of this, and if 
						one could compare the masterpieces of the past to living 
						fossils, the classical &quot;stars&quot; could be compared to 
						traveling curators. Never before in the history of music 
						have living composers had as much competition from dead 
						ones as they do today: a famous masterpiece by a famous 
						composer, performed by a famous interpreter, is the 
						highest-yield, lowest-risk stock.<br>
						<br>
						As the power of the aristocracy faded, the patrons, who 
						in earlier times commissioned pieces from composers, 
						were replaced in the nineteenth century by publishers, 
						by the general public, and by the amateur market. With 
						this change, Western classical music was dethroned as 
						the only musical art money could buy, and the doors were 
						symbolically and literally opened to other kinds of 
						musical venture.</font></td>

						<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Popular music, for example, was brought out of obscurity 
						and into the concert hall mainly through cabaret, a 
						variety of caf’ conc’ (cafe concert), which gave popular 
						music a stable outlet from the mid–nineteenth century 
						onward. Whether we consider the caf’ conc’ of Europe or 
						club performances in the United States, the genealogy of 
						the pop star is primarily connected to the oppressed and 
						to those racially or economically discriminated against. 
						Since popular music could not depend on support from the 
						rich and sophisticated as classical music did, it relied 
						on ordinary men and women and their purchasing power. 
						Because of the popular
						song’s intrinsic simplicity and its appeal to the 
						artistically unsophisticated, a new market for musical 
						representation of unprecedented dimensions and power was 
						created. The pop star not only embodied the musical 
						tastes of the underprivileged but also became a symbol 
						of social and economic success; he or she became one of 
						the groups who &quot;made it.&quot; Ironically, the symbol of the 
						pop star simultaneously served another role, that of 
						social pacifier: frustration – helplessness and 
						powerlessness – could be infinitely rationalized and 
						sublimated through the image of a socially successful 
						equal.<br>
						<br>
						If the Classical period of Western art music liberated 
						the musician from his preordained social role in the 
						hierarchical world of feudalism, the Romantic era 
						strengthened this process further: the musician’s role 
						as an individualistic and original spirit which had been 
						a new possibility, became an exigency. It is mainly from 
						this era that the image of a suffering, misunderstood 
						genius comes. In other words, the totality of the 
						individual became the exclusive focus of music. The same 
						process that had served to liberate the musician became 
						an instrument of his alienation. The logic of this 
						process can be seen in the historical transformation of 
						the musician’s role and of musical practices in the 
						social context and in the genealogy of musical processes 
						and structures. Several distinct lines of development 
						follow from the Romantic period to today: an increasing 
						complexity of the elements and overall form of music; an 
						integration of spatially (diverse ethnic sources) and 
						temporally (diverse periods) different musical worlds; a 
						replacement of natural frames of reference with 
						artificial or scientific ones; and an increasing 
						elasticity of musical expression.<br>
						<br>
						The rhythmic profile was refined horizontally, to 
						include diverse subdivisions, and vertically, to include 
						complex superpositions: the beat was no longer the 
						carrier of the rhythmic pulse but only a reference in 
						the general flow. Melody and harmony followed the 
						emancipation of dissonance in horizontal and vertical 
						aspects. The natural hierarchy of the overtone series 
						was replaced by an artificial, relative universe (from 
						drone to modal to major-minor to extended tonal to 
						serial). Similarly, there was a shift from cyclical and 
						periodic forms to aperiodic and nonarchetypal forms.<br>
						<br>
						<img border="0" src="elvis-edit.jpg" width="677" height="307" align="right">Profound psychological changes took place at the same 
						time: if the archetypal form and overtone-based natural 
						hierarchy gave a confining but secure place to the 
						premodern individual, the newly constructed relative 
						universe gave him a limitless but isolating freedom. 
						This freedom resulted primarily from a heroic effort of 
						the intellect, which subsequently became a hallmark of 
						twentieth century music.<br>
						<br>
						Historically speaking, every period’s particular 
						psychosocial reality is manifested in the idiosyncrasies 
						of its musical structures and processes: a strong 
						rhythmic pulse coupled with the pentatonic and modal 
						systems of tribal (folk) music reflected a collective, 
						rather than an individual, consciousness; the tonal 
						system combined with the unified but limited rhythmic 
						profile of Western art music before the twentieth 
						century reflected an increasingly individualistic 
						emotional and intellectual reality; the atonal, 
						aperiodic, free-pulsating music of the contemporary era 
						points to two extremes: at one end, a highly refined but 
						narrowly focused individual consciousness and, at the 
						other, a quasi-scientific, ego-free and thus impersonal, 
						consciousness.</font><p align="left">

		</font>
						<font size="6">Orientations</font><font size="5"><br>
		</font>If the nineteenth century planted the seeds of spatial and 
		temporal expansion, the twentieth century brought this potentiality to 
		full fruition. A multitude of orientations appeared, which could be 
		roughly classified as follows:<br>
		• The influence of ethnic music<br>
		• Historical awareness and conservation<br>
		• Scientific development and experimentation<br>
		• The explosion of popular idioms and development of communications 
		media.<br>
		<br>
		<font size="6">The Influence of Ethnic Music</font><br>
		Ethnic music has in general been the source of composed music. Although 
		diverse levels of stylization and abstraction of folk elements have 
		characterized different periods, the fundamentals of musical style can 
		usually be traced to ethnic music. At its most particular, folk music is 
		a tradition limited to a certain region and people; at its most 
		universal, a powerful source for synthesis in an international context. 
		West European folk music (and to a lesser extent, that of the 
		Mediterranean region) has been the principal source for Western art 
		music. The history of Western art music is characterized by a process of 
		refinement and complexification, which despite independence and 
		isolation, has often undergone profound transformation through the 
		influence of folk music. One could even argue that most of music history 
		oscillates between the particularity of the folk element and the 
		universality of its stylization.<br>
		<br>
		Although the influence of folk music has been substantial throughout 
		history, it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that 
		the great syntheses of folk and art music took place: I refer primarily 
		to Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Manuel de Falla, Maurice Ohana, Olivier 
		Messiaen, and others in contemporary classical music, as well as to a 
		large number of blues and jazz musicians. Debussy’s music clearly was 
		influenced by oriental music; his use of quartal harmony, pentatonicism, 
		and modality refer to Indonesian gamelan and Chinese folk music. 
		Messiaen’s Promethean synthesis of Indian raag and occidental systems 
		inspired many later developments, although none that match the strength 
		and coherence of his creation. As Stravinsky and Bartók uncovered the 
		powerful rhythmic and melodic structures of east European folk music, 
		such jazz greats as Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis, Don Ellis, John 
		Coltrane, and others accomplished various syntheses of African and other 
		kinds of music, while reintroducing the art of improvisation into the 
		creative process.<br>
		<br>
		Although improvisation was an integral part of musical practices from 
		folk to Renaissance to Baroque, as role specialization increased, 
		improvisation gradually lost its place. According to Piaget’s Psychology 
		of Intelligence, irreversible processes such as perception and 
		semireversible processes such as sensorimotor systems belong to older 
		psychophysical layers of consciousness while reversible processes such 
		as operational thinking belong to newer layers. It is not surprising 
		therefore, that most folk music relies strongly on improvisational 
		practices, especially since such music is based mostly on oral, rather 
		than written, tradition. Both irreversible and reversible processes play 
		major roles in both improvised and composed music. A fundamental 
		difference, however, is that while improvisation occurs irreversibly, 
		the compositional process has the possibility of reversibility. In other 
		words, composition is &quot;frozen in time,&quot; permitting control of the 
		horizontal, vertical, and overall formal aspects of a piece, while 
		improvisation relies mainly on the inspiration and chance of the moment. 
		Yet both improvisation and composition are<br>
		based on unified and elaborate musical systems.<br>
		<br>
		The twentieth century, therefore, reintroduced the vitality of the folk 
		idiom and improvisational practice into musical reality. Psychologically 
		speaking, this reintroduction caused an eruption of older layers of 
		consciousness (magical and mythical) from beneath carefully guarded 
		rational consciousness. A whole generation of composers and improvisers 
		has been experimenting with the integration of these musical universes 
		in various practices such as aleatoric operations, free jazz, and 
		others.</font><p align="left">

						Historical Awareness and Conservation<br>
						</font>As the awareness and inclusion of diverse kinds 
						of ethnic music expanded the musical universe spatially, 
						it simultaneously opened up the temporal dimension as 
						well. The creations of older layers of consciousness not 
						only became available for synthesis with contemporary 
						idioms but also developed a life of their own; this 
						explains the coexistence of the multitudes of musical 
						languages today. The revival of previous periods of 
						Western art music in their totality hand in hand with 
						the revealing of the world’s folklore in its entirety 
						has had two distinctly different functions:
						1) it has created a spatially and temporally transparent 
						musical universe, and 2) it has set in motion a 
						conservative and reactionary
						process, resulting in a creative stasis and a museumlike 
						industry.<br>
						<br>
						<img border="0" src="cookies.jpg" width="425" height="324" align="left">These two functions are perhaps symptomatic of two 
						opposite tendencies at work throughout human history: 
						exploration and openness, and preservation and 
						enclosure. While the first tendency leads to a 
						multiperspectival awareness and subsequent integration 
						of the world, the other tendency emphasizes 
						particularity as an end in itself, and in its exclusive 
						reliance on the known, limits itself to a secure but 
						isolated place. The lack of education and openness, 
						inflexibility in the music industry, and isolation and 
						narrowness in the contemporary classical and jazz idioms 
						are three main reasons for the present situation. All 
						three factors can be traced to a complex interplay of 
						psychosocial and economic processes, which have 
						paradoxically given the individual today an 
						unprecedented potential for spatial and temporal 
						freedom. However, the revealed wealth of the world’s 
						folklore and of past musical periods is most often used 
						not as inspiration for new syntheses but as reactionary 
						formulae for producing more musical (or unmusical) 
						objects.</font></td>

						Scientific Development and Exploration</font><br>
						Refinement and increasing complexity in contemporary 
						music has happened simultaneously with role 
						specialization and the predominance of rational thought 
						over other structures of consciousness. As mentioned 
						earlier, since the Renaissance, a process of 
						perspectivization has created an upheaval in our 
						psychosocial reality, bringing with it a growing 
						reliance on science and on rationality in general. Art, 
						with its potential to express the totality of existence 
						and thus all the phylogenetically inherited layers, has 
						become a way of expressing rational consciousness at the 
						expense of other structures. Music, which has always 
						been a marriage between reason and feeling, pretends 
						either to emulate science or to borrow its subject and 
						method from it. <br>
						<br>
						Finally, by entirely replacing natural frames of 
						reference (such as the overtone series) with artificial 
						ones, the individual has been literally and symbolically 
						cut off from the totality of human experience and 
						consequently has created music in his own fragmented 
						image. This intellectual hypertrophy is also responsible 
						for creating a vacuum that has eagerly been filled by 
						music exclusively based on older layers of 
						consciousness. Minimalism, for example, through its use 
						of gradual transformation based on African (Steve Reich) 
						or Indian (Philip Glass, Terry Riley) ethnic music has 
						brought back the collective archaic consciousness. Much 
						of popular music, even if it is based on industrial 
						cliché, satisfies the need for expressing oneself 
						physically and emotionally.<br>
						<br>
						Thus fragmented, music today reflects, on the negative 
						side, the deep psychosocial schism, and on the positive 
						side, the coexistence of multitudes of spatial and 
						temporal realities. It is not that the promise of the 
						future lies in an indiscriminate synthesis of all these 
						universes (as postmodernist theorists would like us to 
						think) but that the human totality is rediscovered as an 
						integration of both inherited and newly created layers. 
						Accepting who we are will not be an exercise in either 
						complete limitation or in complete freedom. Intellect, 
						similarly, rather than creating incommunicable worlds, 
						will assume the role of coordinator and integrator and 
						not remain an end in itself. If this integration becomes 
						possible, the bridge between the collective and the 
						individual, the particular and the universal, can be 
						rebuilt to create a world aware of both history and the 
						present, here and elsewhere.</font></td>

						Popular Idioms and Communications Media<br>
						</font>The explosion of popular music in the twentieth 
						century has been partly due to the fading power of the 
						aristocracy, along with the increasing power of the 
						middle class; the change in the symbolic and economic 
						value of music and its representation, and the 
						development of the media of communication and of sound 
						recording, or music reproduction by repetition. As 
						mentioned earlier, the invention of the &quot;star&quot; system 
						happened simultaneously with the expansion of the market 
						and the transformation of both music and musician into 
						objects of value. If the first revolutionaries of blues 
						and rock (such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, The 
						Beatles, Jimmy Hendrix, etc.) broke down the 
						psychosocial barriers of their time, their subsequent 
						fetishism and marketability created a space that would 
						be filled by numerous clones and imitators. In the 
						process, the image of these musicians became such a 
						powerful marketing tool (as well as a psychosocial 
						symbol) that a selfperpetuating &quot;star industry&quot; was 
						created, and music became largely a marginal phenomenon 
						(see work by Theodor Adorno).<br>
						<br>
						It was in this way that the new role of “amateur” star 
						came into being. As society further fragmented into 
						public and private spheres, the neurotic split became 
						deeper; the individual with no autonomy could project 
						his needs onto the manufactured image of the &quot;star,&quot; 
						with its invented public life. A simulation, within a 
						simulation, within a simulation.<br>
						<br>
						If pop music’s aesthetic merit is marginal, its 
						psychosocial implications are fundamentally important: 
						its reliance on the basic (older) structures of 
						consciousness serves not only an integrative function 
						but a fragmenting one as well. By integrating the 
						powerless and isolated individual into a fictional life 
						of fulfillment, it robs him of his own creativity and 
						life potential, offering him an ersatz life instead. In 
						other words, what is wrong is not the commercial music 
						itself (in an open music market there should be enough 
						space for all levels and tastes) but the extent of its 
						manipulative power. If contemporary classical and jazz 
						music have something to learn from pop music, it is not 
						to emulate its business strategies (one manipulation 
						equals another) but to strive for a balanced use of 
						psychophysical layers.<br>
						<br>
						One final factor has been crucial in creating the 
						present situation: the almost complete replacement of 
						the concert, as musical representation, by sound 
						recording as repetitive reproduction. Originally, role 
						of recording was that of conservation, not repetition; 
						Edison enumerated possible uses of the phonograph: to 
						conserve memorable speeches and theatrical performances 
						in the public domain, and to conserve the last words of 
						a dying family member or the words of a faraway lover, 
						in the private. It was not until 1898 that the 
						commercial use of the phonograph was discovered. Once 
						understood, the commercial potential of sound recording 
						was exploited to its fullest, thereby creating an 
						upheaval in both our perception and practice of music. 
						The principal transformation took place in pop music: 
						the sound recording, which was originally only an 
						auxiliary of the concert, became the main product. In 
						the process, the unique musical event (the concert) 
						became &quot;windowshopping&quot; for the copy (the sound 
						recording). This victory of the copy over the original 
						is far-reaching in many ways: the musician in live 
						concert is measured against his recording; the recording 
						and its production become the focus of the investor; and 
						finally, the public is replaced by the individual 
						listener. Instead of a living process, music becomes a 
						music-object to be stocked and consumed in solitude. An 
						industry based on serial repetition has therefore 
						produced a new set of values that reflect a statistical 
						reality: the quantity of musicobjects sold defines the 
						value of music. There lies the present axiological 
						confusion, resulting in a total relativizing of values. 
						Such terms as professional and amateur, artist and 
						dilettante, and masterpiece and kitsch become synonyms, 
						thus creating multitudes of both genuine and artificial 
						realities.</font></td>

						If the twentieth century reveals the potential for

						brings with it extreme fragmentation and incoherence. 
						Instead of the balanced integration of psychophysical 
						layers, the overspecialization and hypertrophy of one 
						level at the expense of others is the rule rather than 
						the exception. The result, at one extreme, is 
						complexity, refinement, and the narrowness of a 
						deficient rational consciousness; and at the other, 
						simplification of reality, incoherence, ahistoricity, 
						and reliance on the lowest common denominator and on 
						magical and mythical consciousness. What is mistakenly 
						interpreted as freedom in the domain of mental 
						consciousness is actually the confinement of an isolated 
						intelligentsia, away from the strong roots of the 
						physical, the emotional, and the collective. The 
						exclusive use of older structures, however, relies on 
						the lulling power of the collective unconscious and does 
						not acknowledge the individual’s uniqueness and history, 
						without which the birth of a new multilayered, 
						multiperspectival world remains an abstraction.<br>
						<br>
						The problem of balancing the universal and the 
						particular today becomes a question of survival: as much 
						as an open consciousness in the &quot;here and now&quot; is 
						needed, a historical, evolutionary dimension is also 
						indispensable if a meaningful and coherent reality is to 
						be lived – otherwise, life is only a succession of 
						unconnected moment realities. In denying the particular, 
						one is forced to rely only on older layers of 
						consciousness; in denying the universal, one must rely 
						only on newer layers.<br>
						<br>
						Solutions can be found through the balanced integration 
						of phylogenetically and historically inherited 
						psychophysical layers; through a flexible concept of 
						self, permitting openness and integration; and through 
						an equally flexible concept of profession, permitting a 
						wide range of activities in the context of re-creation 
						and spontaneity. A new spatially and temporally 
						integrated individual might then emerge, who through 
						both freedom and limitation would participate in an 
						awakening of mankind as a &quot;single, living and self-aware 
						entity.&quot;</font></td>
