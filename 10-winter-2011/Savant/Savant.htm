							from position A. But this cunning, persistent 
							opponent exploited Alan’s choice and threw balls 
							with varied spins to the very edge of the table

							rotation. Alan lost in relatively short order,

							changing his approach to the match at any point. For

							one hand behind his back, playing out the match 
							according to a predicted precept, despite that 
							strategy’s obvious failure! I couldn’t grasp why he 
							hadn’t even attempted to adapt. I recalled a story 
							I’d heard years ago about an apparently paraplegic 
							artist who painted with only his feet. When finally 
							it was revealed that the artist actually had full 
							use of his hands, he was asked why he chose to paint 
							with his feet. He replied, “It ‘s the mark of a 
							civilized man to do natural things in an unnatural 
							way.” Apparently Alan was a highly civilized man.</font></span></td>
