						Office” is one painting I easily recall taking a simple 
						storyline and putting each element into place via a 
						series of such windows. This ability to see beyond each 
						canvas’ dimensional limitations was one of his great 
						strengths. Often these small but vibrant windows would 
						easily slip into the psyche of the viewer without being 
						apparent in any out-of-the-ordinary way. They are 
						frequent but basic elements to most of his overall 
						compositions. Each such portion could be seen and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His artistry is something too few people are acquainted

						ink drawing (used by the afore-mentioned music festival) 
						which combines a signature (but stylized) petroglyph 
						figure playing a bass viol with the distant moon perched 
						in an upper corner like a stage hung spotlight. He

						flavor and reasoning behind their festival – funding of 
						a youth scholarship program and providing music teachers
