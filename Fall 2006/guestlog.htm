Space being at a premium no matter the medium, I’ve chosen just a few works of his to demonstrate what makes Wailehua so luminous a figure in the painted chronology of Hawaiian art history. His art of the past several decades, since returning to Hawaii from a lengthy stint in California, fell mainly into two categories. A Zen series that originated from a combination of teacher-oriented studies and his own varied travels thru the Far East, and a Hawaiian series that drew upon the lore he lived and learned from his full-blooded Hawaiian mother and her extended family. Although I&#39;ve often been drawn to works from both arenas it is his “local” style that truly epitomizes his enormous talents to me. I find their depth of meaning rife with both exuberant color and complexity of composition. </p><!--webbot BOT="FormInsertHere" --></body></html>
