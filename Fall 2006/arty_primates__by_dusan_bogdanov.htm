The first time I heard the siamang loud call, it seemed as if the sheer naked 
power of the ape’s vocalization stripped away thousands of years of cultural 
conditioning in a matter of minutes. Despite the confinement of the 
human-constructed ape’s abode, or perhaps in large part because of it, the 
unbridled expression of the voice, coupled with the extraordinary muscular 
acrobatics of the animal, remain one of the most dramatic ”musical” events I 
have experienced to this day. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The world we inhabit is built out of innumerable interlocked timelines. As it is 
true that “some of our molecules remain copies of the molecules formed in 
ancient times” (Jacob, 1973), so some of the most profound realities we 
experience are the living history of our species, and by accepting that history, 
we are accepting the literal life of those ancient forms that is still vibrant 
within us. The unbridgeable chasm we feel between our closest primate kin and 
ourselves is to a large extent directly proportionate to the extent of our 
alienation from our own nature and from the environment in which we evolved. It 
is in this spirit that I have approached the writing of this article, relying 
not only on the scientific information, but also on my own intuition as a 
composer and fellow-primate.<br>
<br>
According to Frans de Waal (1996), “cognitive evolution does not invent new 
categories of behavior. It works with, rather than replaces the ancient 
emotional infrastructure, transforming it by an ever-greater understanding on 
the part of the actors.” Some of the behavioral patterns such as empathy, 
sympathy, identification, imagining the emotional states and actions of fellow 
primates, and others, represent an obvious infrastructure without which the 
creation of art and culture in general would have been impossible.<br>
<br>
Emotional contagion (vicarious arousal by the emotions of others), empathy 
(identification and understanding of others), as well as sympathy (identifying 
and caring about others without loosing one’s identity) are at the roots of 
primates’ expressive communication. If these features led through a long line of 
evolutionary development to the expressive aspects of human interactions, then 
other behavioral complexes such as identification, imitation, purposeful 
deception of others, and replacement of one action by another, led to the 
symbolic aspects of human existence thereby simultaneously creating individual 
and group awareness. <br>
<br>
These two aspects of human interactions: 1) emotional expression and 2) symbolic 
activity remain fundamental modes of human interactions upon which the entire 
edifice of human culture has been constructed. The arts in particular, owe their 
existence to these naturally selected behavioral complexes that have been 
indispensable for our continued survival as individual and social beings (Dissanayake, 
1992). Considering that people in many societies do not even have a word for 
“art” or “music”, it is apparent that a concept such as “primate art” would be 
entirely inappropriate and obfuscating to an already puzzling and obscure 
subject. Nevertheless, there is ample reason for examining primate behaviors 
that are analogous to what we conceive of as artistic.<br>
<br>
Although the separation between expressive and symbolic activities seem 
intuitive, I think that it might be useful to emphasize that this view is held 
in retrospect and that the original unity of these behaviors remains as much 
true for the primates as it does for most indigenous cultures. This is also 
apparent as regards music in particular, whose origins are understood here as 
being essentially multimodal, “composed of movement and mime as well as sound” (Dissanayake, 
2001). Instead of specific artistic or musical behaviors among the apes, we are 
facing what Ellen Dissanayake designated as protomusical (or protoartistic) 
behaviors.<br>
<br>
Among many suspect “musical” activities, the stereotyped loud call seems to be 
characteristic for most primate species. As described by Thomas Geissmann, the 
features of this call include: 1) loudness, 2) acceleration of note rhythm 
(common in chimpanzees and gorillas), 3) a final slow-down in rhythm 
(chimpanzee), 4) higher intensity in the central section of the call (in all 
species of great apes, except orangutans), 5) biphasic notes consisting of 
alternating exhalation and inhalation (absent in gorillas), 6) higher frequency 
in the central section of the call, pure tone of notes (most prominent in 
chimpanzee), and 7) frequent accompaniment with piloerection and a locomotor 
display that may include leg kicking, stomping, branch shaking, vegetation 
slapping or throwing, jumping, running, chest beating or ground thumping (Geissmann, 
2000b).<br>
<br>
Loud calls are also produced by all species of great apes, for instance the hoot 
(gorilla) and pant-hoot (chimpanzee). Both of these calls begin softly with low 
pitches, and through gradual acceleration and rise in pitch and loudness reach 
peaks that resemble a scream (chimpanzee) or a bubbling growl (gorilla). Various 
functions-which are not mutually exclusive- have been proposed for primate loud 
calls, including functions in intra-group cohesion and territorial spacing 
involving mate defense (Cowlishaw 1996; Halloy and Kleiman 1994; Oates and Troco 
1983; Oates et al., 2000; Sekulic 1982; Waser 1977; Whitehead 1987) and resource 
defense (Sekulic 1982; Mitani 1990), and mate-attraction (Mitani 1985; Waser 
1977).<br>
<br>
A special place among ape vocalizations belongs to the solo song bouts and the 
duet song bouts performed by the gibbons or small apes. They do not require much 
imagination to be called songs, as they are long, loud, of pure tone and consist 
of different types of phrases. Song bouts develop through increasing pitch and 
tempo as well as general complexification of structure (Geissmann, 2002). Solo 
song bouts may serve to defend resources (territory, food, trees, mate), 
mate-attraction, and advertisement of fitness. Duet song bouts are produced by 
mated pairs and may have additional functions such as advertisement of the pair 
status, and mate guarding. One gibbon species, the siamang gibbon (Symphalangus 
syndactylus) produces particularly complex duet song bouts (Geissmann, 2000a). 
These complex duets may additionally serve strengthening the pair bond and 
advertising the strength of the pair bond (Geissmann, 1999; Geissmann and 
Orgeldinger, 2000).<br>
<br>
If much of protomusical behaviors we have touched upon so far might represent a 
foundation for human music making in general, the drumming among the chimpanzees 
could present one of the rudiments of human group performance. In captivity, 
chimpanzees often drum on hollow or dead trees and they are also known for the 
so-called rain dance shown close to rainfalls or during thunder or rain (van 
Lawick-Goodall, 1975). Gibbons, Bonobos and various bird species also produce 
antiphonal calls, which resemble so-called hocket technique common in much of 
the world’s folk music (to mention Balinese kecak, African horn ensembles or 
Medieval Western music among others). <br>
<br>
While Table 1 shows possible basic correlation between protomusical and musical 
behaviors, Table 2 demonstrates more complex interrelationships between what 
could be protomusical and musical universals and their ethological origins.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The biphasic vocalization (inhalation/exhalation) functions on an elementary, 
irreducible level of structuring the musical time; it is an action, which 
simultaneously defines the rhythmical duration and its formal counterpart-the 
rhythmic phrase. Combined with a pitch (grunt, pure note, scream or growl), 
biphasic vocalization is a likely candidate for being one of the musical 
universals. <br>
<br>
In another theoretical text, I have attempted to establish a comprehensive 
classification of transformative processes (Bogdanovic, 2006). Motif was chosen 
as the building block of any musical structure. A simple motif was defined by 
two essential parameters: a) rhythm and b) pitch (melody), a complex motif was 
defined by derivative parameters: c) harmony, d) counterpoint, or descriptive: 
e) articulation, f) dynamics, and g) timbre. While this classification seems 
comprehensive enough from a musical theoretical perspective, additional 
categories will be crucial for a description of a protomusical motif viewed from 
a multidisciplinary perspective.<br>
<br>
A protomusical motif would then need added dimensions, such as its ethological 
description as well as its psychosocial function (see Table 3). Biphasic 
vocalization, for example, could be viewed as a structural stepping-stone 
(motif) towards a larger architectural entity-a loud call (song form). Through 
process of emotional amplification via physiological excitation (development 
through tempic acceleration, dynamic and pitch increase), the call would reach 
its peak manifesting in locomotor display and expressive discharge (climax). The 
psychosocial function of a loud call would be presumably interindividual and 
intergroup long distance communication. <br>
<br>
<br>
Table 3. Protomusical and musical universals<br>
<br>
Process Structural prototypes<br>
Acceleration and deceleration of notes Tempic transformation<br>
Slow tempo in the beginning and at the end of the call with acceleration towards 
the central part Rhythmic and tempic transformational prototype<br>
Low pitch in the beginning and at the end of the call, high pitch in the central 
part Melodic structural prototype<br>
High intensity in the central part of the call Dramatic structural prototype<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It does not take a great stretch of imagination to see the connection between 
protomusical and musical categories shown here. While biological and 
psychosocial strata remain fundamental to both phenomena, whole new hierarchies 
are set in motion to produce new layers that are subsequently complexified and 
refined. To quote the French biologist François Jacob again: “...with living 
being as with inanimate objects, there are wheels within wheels. There is not 
one single organization of the living, but a series of organizations fitted into 
one another like nests of boxes in Russian dolls...Each level of organization 
thus brought to light leads to a new way of considering the formation of living 
beings”. (Jacob, 1973)<br>
<br>
Necessarily when viewing complex phenomena such as music, we get overwhelmed by, 
and infatuated with every single layer of the structural hierarchy. However, if 
every layer demands an exclusive focus and attention, we should not loose the 
larger perspective. In that sense, the discontinuity we see between protomusical 
and musical phenomena is a result of our own bias and not of the existing state 
of affairs. The form of an arc with climax in the middle, for example, certainly 
represents one of the prototypic musical formal schemes. From Indian raga to the 
Classical Sonata the essential dramatic and architectural outline remains 
essentially the same as that of the primate loud call. <br>
<br>
Viewed from this perspective, music appears to be one of the virtual realities 
that incorporate philogenetically inherited layers, as creator and creation of 
music might well be one of the unique human phenomena capable of reconnecting us 
to the very origin of our history as a species.<br>
