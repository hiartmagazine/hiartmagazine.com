			The National Gallery of Victoria in 
			Melbourne, Australia is currently presenting a show by Ron Mueck, a 
			hyperrealist sculptor. Entertaining, shocking and awe inspiring, no 
			human could view this show without it having an impact. Does that 
			make it great art? Mueck dances very near the edge of cliché and yet 
			there is definitely something more.</font><p>
			<font face="Arial" size="4">Simply attempting purely 
			representational art in an abstract age is begging for ridicule. 
			Duane Hansen (1925-1996) followed a similar line with his 
			hyperrealist sculpture and took heat from some critics. Hansen’s 
			work was hauntingly real and always life size, often being mistaken, 
			for an instant for the living. With Mueck’s work this would never 
			happen. Although his pieces are far more &quot;real&quot; than Hansen’s they 
			are never to scale and this simple fact makes much more of an impact 
			than one would expect.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Mueck grew up making toys and 
			gravitated to movies and television as a model maker. He quickly 
			became a master of the craft known as animatronics and made some 
			well known figures including Ludo, the gentle giant from the David 
			Bowie film, Labyrinth (he provided the voice, as well). He was 
			commissioned to do a model of Pinocchio that was such a hit that 
			trying his hand at art seemed a natural progression. Mueck admits 
			that he is not driven by art and has been accused of being simply a 
			fine craftsman.</font></td>

			<font face="Arial" size="4">&quot;Dead Dad&quot; was Mueck’s breakout work and 
			is included in the Melbourne show. This piece is a two thirds scale 
			presentation of Mueck’s father laid out unsentimentally on the 
			floor. Stunningly, achingly real, the figure is most decidedly dead. 
			He has captured the pallor, and character of the body that was a 
			short time ago alive. The flesh appears supple and yet has lost the 
			vibrant feel of living tissue. (I am sure if it were touched it 
			would be hard and cold). Mueck is a master craftsman, without doubt.</font><p>
			<font face="Arial" size="4">Scale is critical with all his works. If 
			they were presented life size they would be diminished. A less 
			successful work of art but equally shocking piece is &quot;Girl&quot;, an 
			eighteen foot newborn fetus. She has just emerged from the womb and 
			has one eye barely starting to open and become aware. A toddler 
			viewing the piece was fascinated with the umbilicus protruding the 
			belly. It was delightful to see his mother pull up his shirt, point 
			to his pico and give a few word explanation of his origin. His 
			reaction was both revulsion and laughter, perfect!</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="4">Mueck’s work would be completely 
			hollow if it were not for his uncanny ability to show us at our most 
			vulnerable. The works are extremely emotional, yet not the raw drama 
			of the traumatic side of life but the subtle pensive side. The 
			twenty two foot &quot;Woman in Bed&quot; could easily be dismissed as a waste 
			of space until a close look at her eyes reveal a sadness that is 
			palpable. Once she locks on with her gaze she will not let go and 
			insists that the viewer share her melancholia.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="4">Originally from Melbourne, Mueck has 
			worked in London for twenty years. He proceeds from drawings to 
			small works and then chooses the scale that suits a particular 
			piece. Large pieces require substantial steel armatures that are 
			filled out with different materials including Styrofoam then 
			finished in clay. This clay model is then used to create a mold that 
			results in a cast resin figure. This piece is then manipulated, 
			painted and added to until it is perfectly anatomically correct down 
			to the pours. The hair is sometimes glued on. For large pieces each 
			hair is glued into a drilled hole. The process is painstaking and 
			extremely meticulous.</font></p></td>
