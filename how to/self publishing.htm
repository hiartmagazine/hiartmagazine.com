										If you’ve ever dreamed of seeing your 
										work in print – your unpublished novel, 
										poetry, cartoons, photographs, or a 
										catalogue of your paintings – here’s 
										news, both good and bad, but mostly 
										good, based on recent experience.</font><p>
										<font color="#C0C0C0">I wanted to 
										publish a memoir about the first year my 
										husband and I, two greenhorn city types, 
										spent living off the grid in a Hawaiian 
										mountain rainforest. With three chapters 
										and an outline written, I felt I had 
										some funny yet informative stories to 
										tell. <br>
										<br>
										I sent query letters to two &quot;green&quot; 
										publishers, asking if they’d read a 
										proposal. One of them not only read but 
										sent a two-page e-mail rave review. He 
										thought I needed a bigger publisher to 
										do the book justice – encouraging, but 
										still a rejection.</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">I’ve been this 
										route before and didn’t really want to 
										go there again – the waiting, the gentle 
										turndown, the new query letter to a new 
										publisher.. I began to think about 
										self-publishing. With our off-grid Do It 
										Yourself lifestyle, I’d learned so many 
										new things. If I could now tend to the 
										needs of our solar electric system, 
										re-program the computer when my wireless 
										internet went South, meanwhile splitting 
										kindling for the woodstove, and helping 
										repair our country road, how hard could 
										it be to publish a book? I decided to go 
										for it.</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Self-publishing 
										used to be expensive. Authors with a 
										garage full of tomes they created, 
										bulk-ordered, and couldn’t sell, will 
										attest to that. Ten thousand dollars was 
										not a lot to spend for a first printing 
										of a few thousand books. But all that 
										has changed. There’s been a revolution 
										in publishing known as &quot;on-demand 
										digital printing.&quot;</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">With on-demand 
										printing, one book – that’s right ONE 
										book! - can be printed at any time, just 
										for the person, anywhere in the world, 
										who wants it. Is that amazing? There 
										will be no left-overs (save a tree). Nor 
										will a book go out of print. And 
										uploading text and graphics to an 
										on-demand publisher’s website is free.
										</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">I said &quot;free&quot; 
										but I didn’t say &quot;easy.&quot; I had to read 
										and re-read many a website page before I 
										could even begin to understand 
										instructions for publishing a book to be 
										made available to the public (as opposed 
										to a private one that’s only for the 
										author or a limited number of viewers). 
										I had to create a 6&quot; X 9&quot; trade 
										paperback book, perfect-bound (which 
										means it has a spine), with specific 
										page margins, text fonts, and page 
										numbering. Establishing this format 
										early on was helpful as I finished 
										writing the book. I could see how long a 
										chapter ought to be, and whether an 
										important sentence was chopped in half 
										by a page break. </font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">&quot;Free&quot; went out 
										the window, though, when my Mac 
										word-processing program wouldn’t shake 
										hands with a page-making template 
										provided by my chosen manufacturer. I 
										had to buy software, incurring my first 
										cost, about $200.00, then learn how to 
										use the new tools – picture 
										headscratching and the occasional 
										Anglo-Saxon expletive.</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Even then, 
										being off the grid, using a cellphone as 
										a somewhat pokey connection to the 
										internet, I needed the help of a 
										computer professional with a PC, a land 
										line, and DSL to successfully upload my 
										files to the manufacturer’s website. 
										Luckily, I knew the perfect person, a 
										friend and graphic designer who’d 
										already been the midwife of a 
										print-on-demand book.. She could also 
										design the cover. Her expertise and 
										support were a boon. Like me, she was 
										not at the beach, nor in her garden 
										growing green beans, but stuck in front 
										of a computer trying to coax it to do 
										what she wanted. While I was having fits 
										over text flow and spacing, she was 
										having them over the size of my ISBN bar 
										code. I paid an hourly rate for her work 
										which totaled about $1,000.00 – beyond 
										worth it. </font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Before the book 
										was ready for people, I made plenty of 
										mistakes: it wasn’t just technical 
										issues, there were errors in punctuation 
										and consistency. Without an editor, I 
										had to muddle through. But, finally, the 
										day came to see it in print. As strongly 
										suggested by the manufacturer, I only 
										ordered one copy, then haunted the post 
										office waiting for its arrival.</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Oh, the feeling 
										of seeing your beautiful book for the 
										first time! The cover’s cute! The 
										introductory pages are fun! BUT . . . 
										Ohhh no! Every chapter begins with Page 
										143! How the heck did that happen? And 
										how on earth do I fix it?</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">I revised and 
										printed three test books before the 
										knots in my stomach were gone. Then, 
										with no more glaring goofs, I bought a 
										distribution package, approved the book, 
										and it was suddenly, miraculously, 
										widely available, in print and as a 
										download. </font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">The 
										distribution package from my 
										manufacturer cost a mere $100.00 (more 
										if you want extra services). It includes 
										a &quot;storefront&quot; on their website and 
										listings with various wholesalers and 
										retailers. My only other costs have been 
										$25.00 for barcode creation and $30.00 
										for a Library of Congress control 
										number. Plus the cost of books I’ve 
										ordered - recently, six used for 
										promotion. </font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">If I buy 
										copies, I pay the rock bottom price 
										which is based on a book’s size, number 
										of pages, quality of paper, etc. But 
										it’s not my object to buy them or sell 
										them myself. I want the book to be sold 
										by others. Therefore, I kept it in an 
										affordable retail price-range, under 
										$20.00, by keeping the page-count low, 
										and so far, it’s been selling at the 
										rate of one or two books a day. </font>
										</p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Promotion of my 
										print-on-demand book is, once again, Do 
										It Yourself. The New York Review of 
										Books won’t review it, and most 
										book-prize givers won’t consider it. But 
										in these wonderful internet days, there 
										are so many ways to let people know it’s 
										out there. It can be previewed and 
										peer-reviewed on-line at my 
										&quot;storefront,&quot; which is easily found by 
										typing the book’s title into the search 
										space on the manufacturer’s website.</font></p>
										<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Okay, having 
										read this article, if you still long to 
										see your work in print; and if you 
										regard your computer as a friend, not a 
										filthy traitorous enemy; and if you have 
										patience with yourself while flailing 
										around in the unknown, then 
										self-publishing a print-on-demand book 
										is an option I recommend. Nothing tops 
										the feeling of holding your own book in 
										your own hands, except, perhaps, 
										feedback from readers enthusing, &quot;I 
										couldn’t put it down!&quot;</font></font></div>
