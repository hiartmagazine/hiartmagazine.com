		When we visit an art exhibition, at least one piece often bares the 
		ubiquitous sign, &quot;N.F.S.&quot; In our society today, the idea of something 
		occupying commercial space, yet being 'Not For Sale' is an anomaly. 
		Usually it means that the object in question was already sold to someone 
		and is now just on loan for exhibit. More rarely, the piece of art is so 
		personal, the artist doesn't want to sell it. <br>
		<br>
		Maybe that's the attraction of museums: things not for sale - things so 
		much a part of our history and culture that they have value, yet are 
		beyond sale. But usually we pay a fee to enter museums or at least are 
		solicited for donations; so at least attendance is for sale. It's 
		capitalism at work! The founding economic system of our country was 
		capitalism. Feudal lords didn't run America as they'd once run Europe. 
		Common people weren't excluded from access to wealth. That was our 
		freedom. Democracy had been at work since the Magna Carta overthrew the 
		monarchy in England. Grass roots capitalism, however was seeded in 
		America. <br>
		<br>
		Here everything is for sale! The notion was that everyone had access to 
		the government, so access to money and power was for all. But during the 
		last century a popular revolution occurred as mass media developed. 
		Music, politics, art… almost everything you could think of became 
		merchandize, to be sold to as many people as possible through a 
		disseminating media machine that could sell just a small part of a 
		persona or idea, to a large population.

		<br>
		When I first arrived in America in 1965, there was an underground music 
		scene evolving - people you could only hear on extreme radio. New voices 
		arose and they were fresh and threatening to the establishment. Names 
		like Jimi Hendrix or Janis Joplin or Bob Dylan were part of a reaction 
		against America For Sale. But the youth of America wanted it, and so, in 
		the end it found its way to the market. Once it became clear that there 
		was money in rebellion, nothing new could emerge without it being 
		immediately sponsored, packaged and merchandized to a mass market for 
		profit. <br>
		<br>
		In 1979, an actor - and not a very good one - ran for president in a 
		democracy where everyone had a choice. During his campaign Ronald Reagan 
		proclaimed that it was time to reduce national controls on pollution 
		emissions since smog in the state of California he governed, had been 
		'substantially controlled'. Coincidently, that day the front page of the 
		L.A. Times was adorned with an image of the tips of a few buildings 
		emerging from a gray cloud, subtitled with Reagan's quote. <br>
		<br>
		Yet he won. It didn't make sense. But it wasn't about democracy, it was 
		about capitalism. The presidency was a marketable commodity that was for 
		sale through good advertising. Television had become the medium that 
		sold the position. Of course an actor would be the perfect choice to 
		fill the niche. <br>
		<br>
		</font>
		<img border="0" src="twin_towers_edit.gif" width="312" height="288" align="left"><font face="Arial">Twenty 
		years later, when George W. Bush attacked Iraq he said 'They attacked us 
		first!' Yet there were no Iraqis on the plane that flew into the Twin 
		Towers. 'We have to fight back,' he insisted. 'Why not attack Paraguay?' 
		some might have wondered. But the war had been purchased with hard 
		earned media dollars. Public opinion had been bonded and secured with 
		federal money and was being spent in the service of our founding 
		principle: the making of profit. <br>
		<br>
		Something insidious has happened to the country of opportunity, where 
		once original voices were heard, and innovative minds from around the 
		world came for venue. The principle upon which the country was founded - 
		not the one we sell, democracy - but the one we buy, capitalism, has 
		created a nation in which everything is for sale. <br>
		<br>
		Politicians in the 50's and 60's, told Americans that the great enemy of 
		our democracy was Communism, now it's Terrorism. We've often missed the 
		distinction that democracy is a political system and communism is an 
		economic system, not theoretically in conflict. Today terrorism is a 
		military strategy, neither a political system, nor and economic one. <br>
		<br>
		From all this rhetoric you might think that I must be a communist or 
		perhaps even a terrorist, but I'm not. I'm an evolutionist. You probably 
		didn't think that 'evolutionism' was a political system like democracy, 
		or an economic system like communism, or even a strategy like terrorism, 
		but maybe it's all three: <br>
		In biology today, we no longer understand Charles Darwin's principle of 
		natural selection as 'survival of the fittest,' some sort of 
		socio-economic battleground in which the most aggressive dominate. Today 
		we understand that evolution of life is rather 'the survival of the best 
		fit.' At any given place or time, a principle or adaptation that once 
		worked well for an organism, might cease to be effective and even cause 
		its demise when the environment changes. <br>
		<br>
		Competition as a principle has limits: The cheetah, for example, fastest 
		animal on earth is competitively adapted to breed, hunt and kill, but 
		only on the run. In our modern world, that preeminent competitive 
		adaptation, so successful once, has doomed that species to extinction. 
		In zoos the cheetah can hide but it can't run. On the other hand, 
		powerful species like ants have succeeded for millions of years upon 
		cooperative principles. They have become competitive between species by 
		limiting competition within their species. <br>
		<br>
		Humans, uniquely have harnessed the dichotomous principles of high 
		competition and high cooperation within and between species to our 
		advantage. We are the most cooperative of primates, and the also the 
		most competitive. We adapt to times and places to distinguish the 
		appropriate circumstances for each strategy. As we see in family, 
		sports, and even war, friends become enemies and enemies become friends 
		at advantageous times. Emblemized politically, capitalism might 
		exemplify competition while communism epitomizes cooperation. The brief 
		political history of this century has shown us that if we compete too 
		heavily we become isolated by our aggression. The fall of communism in 
		the last one demonstrated that if we compete too little we are 
		overwhelmed by the motivated. </font>
		<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
		<img border="0" src="evolution-web.gif" width="649" height="288"><br>
		</p>
		<p>So, as humans we live an oscillating system of cooperation and 
		competition, adapting to time and place, often alternating strategies 
		regularly. But as with the cheetah, when we lean upon a canalized 
		principle such as unlimited competitive capitalism for too long, we find 
		ourselves unable to adapt. Within our country, public opinion is 
		purchased for profit. By selling ourselves questionable information we 
		isolate our country internationally, and ultimately render ourselves as 
		fragile as the storied cheetah. <br>
		<br>
		The few who control the sales media have become modern 'feudal lords' 
		who have bought and sold democracy to a nation of indentured servants. 
		Half a century ago in America it seemed important ethically that people 
		sold you something valuable. Now it seems important just to close a 
		sale. If you can't afford a product, then someone will sell you the 
		money to buy it. It's called credit. You pay it off with your future.
		<br>
		<br>
		In this country, freedom was supposed to be 'Not For Sale.' But in the 
		museum which our culture has become, the N.F.S. sign beside freedom, now 
		just means someone already bought it, and it's now just here for 
		exhibit.</font></p><br>
