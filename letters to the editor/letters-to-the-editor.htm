									Many thanks for this eloquent, beautifully

									Dear Stephen,<br>
									<br>
									I've just received and read the last idspace 
									message informing me of its closing. Even if 
									I left Hilo Hawai'i more than 5 years ago, 
									it was always with happiness and great 
									pleasure that I received and read idspace 
									news letters, and always with a little 
									sadness to live so far away and not been 
									able to join and visit the openings and the 
									shows. <br>
									<br>
									I remember so vividly you beautiful and 
									genuine place. You, Randy and all the others 
									will always have a special place in my 
									heart. It is with true sadness that I read 
									that it is a good bye newsletter. <br>
									<br>
									I wish you, from the bottom of my heart, to 
									succeed in your projects and new challenges. 
									I warmly want to thank you, and all the 
									others who participate in this fantastic 
									project - the idspace, for this great 
									accomplishment and for all you did for the 
									artists and residents of Hawai'i and for 
									Hawai'i.<br>
									<br>
									I hope to have the chance to visit Hawai'i 
									soon and maybe to have the pleasure to 
									meeting you again!<br>
									<br>
									With much aloha, Hélène<br>

									So very sorry to hear of this trouble.&nbsp; Such

									labor of love&nbsp;it has been from&nbsp;you and your 
									household.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will miss these

									Magazine.&nbsp; Obviously&nbsp;the magazine&nbsp;is also a 
									labor of love.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your 
									invitations to these exhibits at&nbsp;your home. 
									&nbsp;I have been very honored to have been 
									included&nbsp;in invitations to&nbsp;these shows.&nbsp; If 
									you are accepting any donations to help 
									offset the&nbsp;cost of the fines, I could 
									contribute a little to help with 
									that.&nbsp;Blessings on you all.&nbsp; Fine work:)&nbsp;<br>
									Best thoughts, Diana<br>

									I had heard about you from my friend Amaury 
									St Gilles, and hoped to be able to exhibit 
									with you one day... a space that so clearly 
									was loved by many in the community - after 
									all, gathering the community together is a 
									big part of what Art can do! Maybe some 
									&quot;mystery&quot; exhibits - large or small - can 
									spring up here and there around the island! 
									The thought gives me ideas!<br>

									idspace is a special part of us and had 
									hoped for another show or event or project

									looking forward to seeing more shows at the 
									great space and being on the spectacular

									very sad...We will still have Hi Art 
									Magazine to look forward to, right? Please

									<br>
									I am so sad to read that this wonderful, 
									magical place where one could find such 
									inspiration and beauty will no longer be 
									able to welcome us back again. How sad for 
									you - to see your dream so completely 
									fulfilled only to see it abruptly come to an 
									end as well. And, selfishly, how sad for us 
									- where can we go to nourish our sense of 
									esthetic? What will happen to you? And, what 
									will happen to us? This can't be true.<br>
									<br>
									Are there any that can continue your dream 
									in another space? You are so right about the 
									commercial galleries. Your space was so 
									personal, those who came were somehow 
									connected - we were not strangers. Your 
									space and the art was such a refuge. Can't 
									we continue somewhere? What does it take? 
									But, another place will never have your 
									gardens, your little gallery lit up in the 
									dark, and the wonderful sense of being safe 
									among friends.<br>
									<br>
									Please let us know if we can do anything - 
									anything at all - to help in any way. I am 
									very very sad.<br>
									With much appreciation and aloha, Elisabeth

									Oh No Stephen!<br>
									I am so sorry to see your place go. Hawaii 
									so needed your commitment to the arts.<br>
									That being said, I totally understand how 
									tough it must be to try to survive in that 
									environment. IMHO the people of Hawaii 
									totally undervalue the visual arts. Being an 
									artist in NYC is very tough, and there is 
									way more of an accepted perception of the 
									value of the arts here.<br>
									idspace has held a very special place for

									<p align="left">It was with great sadness 
									that I read of the closing of Id space. I 
									only attended 3 openings there, --but it was 
									a true treasure, &amp; a fabulous effort that 
									was extremely successful. I hope that the 
									HIArt newsletter continues, as I read each 
									issue &quot;cover to cover&quot;--- it is a wonderful 
									source of what's happening in art for us 
									Hawaii artists. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
									Please stop into One Gallery at 128 Kilauea. 
									Just up from the farmers market. Our mission 
									to function as a commercial gallery by &amp; for 
									artists. It isn't as sophisticated as Id 
									space, &amp; we do carry little gift items... We 
									have only been open since January, and it 
									has been a very slow process of getting art 
									of substantial quality, but that is one of 
									our major goals. We have to planting &amp; keep 
									weeding.. it's truly like a garden. <br>
									...One Gallery is an artists collective, 
									owned &amp; operated primarily by Deborah 
									Beaver, Eva Anderson, &amp; Amy Markham. It'd&nbsp; 
									be wonderful if any of you came in to check 
									us out &amp; shared your insight &amp; feedback. <br>
									a hui hou, &amp; mahalo for your idspace experience....... Amy Markham<br>

									Dear Stephen,<br>
									We met via UH with Suzanne Wolfe a number of 
									years ago. My name then was Gail Bakutis. I 
									since moved to Maui and am Arabella Ark.<br>
									I am shocked and saddened to hear your 
									calamitous story... I find the county and 
									state regulations insane and discriminatory. 
									I have also never before (i've lived in 
									Hawaii for 40 years) heard that an artist 
									cannot make and show and sell his own work 
									on his own land.<br>
									I am sorry you have closed. It is a wrongful 
									situation. I send this info in sympathy and 
									dismay.<br>
									Aloha, Arabella</p>

									I just read your story…how very very sad the 
									story is….The exhibits look wonderful. 
									Hopefully something new will pop up for you. 
									Thank you for Hawaii arts magazine.<br>
									Art and artists always have struggled 
									through the ages and this is probably no 
									different. I have devoted my life to the 
									arts on Kauai and am about burned out. I 
									hope to meet you on the big island at the 
									opening of the Faces of Hawaii show.<br>

																				<p>...Andrea was astonished to see the extraordinary beginnings of Leonardo, and urged Ser Piero that he should make him study it; wherefore he arranged with Leonardo that he should enter the workshop of Andrea, which Leonardo did with the greatest willingness in the world.

							Aloha my name is Teak Ruby-Ano. 
							I'm an aspiring photographer born and raised on 
							Kaua'i. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend 
							HI Art Magazine's, &quot;Faces of Hawaii&quot; book debut 
							in the last week of November 2010. It was my very 
							first social event as an amateur photographer and I 
							have to say I was very impressed with everything. 
							From the layout of the gallery to the property it 
							sits on, it was unreal. <br>
							<br>
							I encourage anyone who has just the slightest 
							interest in photography to attend next year and all 
							the years to come. The people you'll meet, to the 
							contacts and friends you'll make are priceless. HI Art Magazine worked very hard 
							to put everything together and it showed. I enjoyed 
							it all. The experience, the place, the whole nine 
							yards. <br>
							<br>
							I must say I was very nervous at the 
							beginning, which many folks reading this may feel as 
							well, but don't be. I'm a seriously amateur 
							photographer and everyone I met was so encouraging 
							and nice, that I left with a very positive notion 
							that maybe I really can become a really great 
							photographer one day. Having people look at your 
							work and really critique it was so uplifting. <br>
							<br>
							Many thanks to Patti and Steve for all their hard work. 
							As well as all of HI Art Magazine. <br>

							The world is not just.<br>
							<br>
							I met Wayne while we were students at UH (a long 
							time ago), and even then his generosity of spirit 
							was evident. Although I barely knew him, he freely 
							discussed, critiqued and challenged this 
							underclassman's art. He gave, I gained. We lost 
							contact, I moved to New York. Then, many years 
							later, a well known artist friend said, &quot;I met this 
							guy in&nbsp; <br>
							Africa I think you know&quot;. Of course it was Wayne. I 
							was surprised, but should have known better.<br>
							<br>
							More recently I had the pleasure of spending time in 
							Hilo with the guy. A place he truly loved. To see 
							him on native ground, with his particular mix of 
							nurturing and challenging students, was a joy. And 
							the simultaneous enjoyment he took in international 
							art along with local eateries was life at its 
							fullest. A big vision, heart, and appetite fed by 
							curiosity and respect for the &quot;locals&quot; of the world.<br>
							<br>
							I'll miss him. And hope his family the very best.
