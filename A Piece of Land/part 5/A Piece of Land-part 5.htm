							<p align="justify"><span LANG="EN-GB">In </span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">45 
							on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of October the army came here 
							and was stationed in Lesko with all their transport; 
							they had horses there. They came to get some fodder 
							for them: hay, grain and oats. And the farmers say: 
							&quot;Our village is ruined, the fields have gone wild 
							from not being ploughed, go to the next door village 
							where there are locals, they weren</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							displaced and there you</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">ll 
							get something quickly.&quot; So they went to Bere&#378;nica. 
							When they got there, the villagers were killing a 
							calf belonging to one of Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men in the middle of the village and roasting the 
							meat for future supplies in the forest. When they 
							saw that the Polish army was coming they opened fire 
							on them, and injured a soldier. It ended with that, 
							the army retreated and returned to Lesko. <br>
							<br>
							In Lesko </span><span LANG="EN">–</span><span LANG="EN-GB"> 
							I was small, I can</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							remember, but dad used to say that the commanding 
							officer gave an order and in an instant two tanks 
							came here, stood by the San and gave two shots there 
							and there. Two army cars went to those places and we 
							could already see flames. A few people died there; 
							they burned down houses. That was on Tuesday, 
							because they were going from Lesko by carts and they 
							didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							go there because they were scared; they stayed the 
							night at my neighbour</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							house, at our friends. And on Wednesday they came to 
							Myczkowce to get their revenge. Our house was the 
							first one on entering the village; it wasn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							our own because our previous one was taken apart. We 
							lived in a farm building where the paint shop was. 
							It was a wooden house. <br>
							<br>
							On the other side of the San river Nowak had a farm, 
							on this side were the manor buildings. There were 
							also buildings there; lots of people lived there, 
							they would come and have a place to stay. Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men went there and didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							spare anyone, Cycek Antoni and Stefan Dydacki, who 
							had only just come back from Germany and wasn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							aware of the danger; he didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							know what Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men were or what they were capable of. They came to 
							this older man and wanted to drag him outside. He 
							was a lively man though and struggled his way out 
							and was left alone but they took the other two and 
							in a moment they heard shots. They shot him 
							practically on his doorstep. They crossed the ford 
							through the San. <br>
							<br>
							Józef P&#322;aksa lived on the other side. He takes a 
							look around and his wife comes up to him and says 
							someone</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							going across the river. He replies that maybe the 
							Polish army is coming back from action. He looks 
							around and then they come to him; Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men. They shot him straight away on the meadow. Then 
							they came to us, surrounding the first house. I was 
							12. At that moment people get an amazing sense of 
							power; I don</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							know if any of my peers would have done the same 
							thing in my situation. My father was lying asleep on 
							his bed, dinner was being cooked, there were eight 
							of us in the family. Gran was sitting on her bed; my 
							sister was one-and-a-half years old. Mum told me to 
							change her skirt which was hanging on the stove. 
							Suddenly we hear from behind the wall, shots. Mum 
							immediately went to wake Dad up: Franek, get up, it</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							lot! Dad jumped out of bed and escaped outside. <br>
							<br>
							This 
							was all happening around one building with no 
							stables but a kind of shed which he had prepared for 
							the cows for the winter months. As soon as he ran 
							out and saw that there are so many of Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men he turned around but it was very dark and it was 
							raining and kind of hanging drizzle. Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							mob didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							know the area, and my father knew where to go and 
							fled for the stables. He got there and one of 
							Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men was right behind him and started to fire. When 
							he started firing a horse which was tied by the 
							doors started jumping, and he was too scared to go 
							on because he didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							want to be trampled. Dad ran to the window, broke it 
							open while getting injured at the same time. The 
							bullet entered him here; it damaged a tendon and 
							later he had contracture of his arm. He climbed out 
							of the window; the bandit had gone around, there 
							were some barbed-wire entanglements because the 
							police had been there. Later, when Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men started raiding the police station they took 
							them from here for reinforcement to Olszanica, 
							because it</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							a different story if you have bigger groups rather 
							than police stations with just a few people in them.
							<br>
							<br>
							I jumped up onto the table, and onto the stove 
							because I wanted to take the baby</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							vest and at once I heard a shot at the window. Had 
							there been electric light he wouldn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							have missed but we had a paraffin lamp; it was dark 
							inside. He injured Gran badly; she fell onto the 
							floor and started to cry in agony and then he fired 
							again into the other window at me. I swear I heard 
							the bullet whistle passed me around a foot in front 
							of me. I only saw shards fly off from the stove. I 
							knew that when they came they are going to set the 
							place on fire because every night you could see the 
							flames from other fires in the distance; they would 
							set houses on fire and murder people and I realized 
							that the same fate had come to us; what we had 
							feared most. <br>
							<br>
							I dashed to my bed where there were two pillows and 
							a quilt; I bent over and took the baby and 
							everything else outside. Today I wouldn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							have done that. I hauled everything out and I don</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							know; whether it was God deciding that my time had 
							not yet come, because I can</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							explain it any other way, because I am sure that 
							Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							lot saw me. They were very aggravated by the whole 
							situation; you could see it. They had nervous voices 
							when giving orders when they would talk to each 
							other. There was a very large ash tree whose 
							branches would spread out and I went there. I threw 
							aside the two pillows because I thought out here 
							they won</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							burn when they set the house on fire but I took the 
							quilt, knowing that when I went to sleep the baby 
							had to be wrapped up. I could die but at least the 
							baby would survive. We crawled under the barbed 
							wire; we knew the way because we used to go that way 
							when we were kids. The wire caught the baby and I 
							had to calm her down: &quot;Quiet, Józia, quiet now, don</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							cry…&quot; <br>
							<br>
							And so I went into the garden and sat under the nut 
							tree. It was the 3<sup>rd</sup> October; it was wet 
							and wet leaves were falling from the tree. And I</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">m 
							sitting there. The quilt was bright pink on one 
							side; on the other a dark crimson. I thought to 
							myself that the darker colour will be harder to spot 
							in the dark so I took the quilt and started to turn 
							it around and wrap the baby in it. As I started a 
							whole bunch of leaves fell; I had moved a nearby 
							hedge. At that moment </span><span LANG="EN">–</span><span LANG="EN-GB"> 
							something which I didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							know about then </span><span LANG="EN">–</span><span LANG="EN-GB"> 
							one of Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men was standing right behind me, he came closer and 
							I heard the click of his gun being taken off the 
							safety catch. He cried out nervously: &quot;Who</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							there?&quot; So I think to myself: &quot;I escaped here but 
							where to now? If I answer him, he</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">ll 
							know where I am, fire off a round and kill me and if 
							I don</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							say anything he</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">ll 
							fire one off just to make sure and seriously injure 
							me and I</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">ll 
							be in agony just like my Gran a moment ago.&quot; But I 
							couldn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							bring myself to say anything; my throat was so 
							tense. I still get anxious even now just thinking 
							about it, it all comes flooding back as if I find 
							myself in the same situation again. I clenched my 
							fists, maybe it</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							a slightly childish thing to do, just like going to 
							the dentist</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							and then clenching your fists so you think it won</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							hurt as much. <br>
							<br>
							I took the baby close to me and I sat deadly still, 
							and waited for what seemed to be an eternity. And 
							this man from Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							mob shouts out again: &quot;Who</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							there?!&quot; At the same time just try and imagine if it 
							was not my destiny determined by God, a miracle, 
							that God had decided that my time hadn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							come yet; at the same time when the man asked who 
							was there was another one of Bandera</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							men just behind him who was sure that the question 
							was directed at him so he replies: &quot;</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">m 
							going into the house.&quot; So one of them went one way, 
							the second the other. I pinched myself just to make 
							sure I was still alive. Anyone who hasn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							gone through something like that cannot begin to 
							explain what it</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							like. <br>
							<br>
							He went to our quarters and took the paraffin lamp. 
							When I left the house with the baby I</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">m 
							sure there was a sack of potatoes, earlier there 
							were sacks which Gran would stitch together with 
							white cloth. My grandfather had white cloth 
							underwear; he got out of bed, he was lying on the 
							floor. I went over him and left into the garden. I 
							didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							see my mother. Dad got back to the house after 
							everything was over. They burnt down the house and 
							went further into the village, where they shot W&#322;adek 
							Tubulewski. Past the wall where we were living shots 
							were fired and the first to go was Stanis&#322;aw 
							Tubulewski, 42 years old, with four children. <br>
							<br>
							Later I thought to myself: &quot;Maybe there</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							someone injured in the house and I won</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							be able to save them because the house is on fire.&quot; 
							My father sat in the garden injured; he went slowly 
							into our quarters. He stumbled upon my mother and 
							shook her but she was already dead. He went along to 
							Gran</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							bed but she too was already lying dead on the 
							ground. There was smoke everywhere, blood pouring 
							out, the whole incident, stress. And dad says that 
							he</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							scared that he</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							about to lose consciousness so he</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">ll 
							fall over and burn along with the house. Flames were 
							coming up to the door; there was no other way out. 
							He managed to break open a window and went into the 
							garden again. Dad saved us four children. My sister 
							was one and a half. She</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							now a retired school teacher; she lives in Sanok. I 
							said to her, &quot;Józia, come with us,&quot; because we were 
							going to the Ukraine to where we used to live, 
							because that</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">s 
							where she was born. But she said, &quot;I can</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t.&quot; 
							I didn</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							have a childhood thanks to them. As they say: &quot;You 
							can forgive but you can</span><span LANG="EN">’</span><span LANG="EN-GB">t 
							forget; you have to remember.&quot; Twelve people died 
							then.</p>
