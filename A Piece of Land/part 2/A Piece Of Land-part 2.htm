							When the Germans came, they performed raids on the 
							Jews. There was a manor house where Josko lived, 
							Berko lived below. There were only 3 of them. There 
							were more earlier but I can’t remember them. Jews 
							lived at the top of the house but they left earlier. 
							What I can remember is that I went to see them, I 
							can talk about that. <br>
							<br>
							There was a German campaign to round up all the 
							Jews, there were raids. The village leader, the 
							So&#322;tys, he was a Ukrainian and he gave everyone 
							away. The Germans liked the Ukrainians better than 
							the Poles, I don’t know why. At the time they were 
							impounding people, not just here, but in the whole 
							district, and there were lots of Jews around. And in Uherce, and in Lesko. Lesko 
							was almost a Jewish town. There weren’t many Poles 
							in it at all, almost everyone was Jewish. The Jews 
							would take swine, cows, goats and sheep for meat 
							production, a Jewish butcher would do the work and that’s where 
							everyone went to buy meat. It wasn’t all that 
							expensive, Jews would sell sausages on the street. 
							Everyone was Jewish there. I remember, I used to 
							go there by cart with my grandfather and we would 
							often buy produce from them, even jelly, I remember 
							that. <br>
							<br>
							Then the German government decided that it would 
							slay them. An order came from HQ that they had to 
							get rid of the Jews – so they did. They came in a 
							tank and they also had an armoured personnel 
							vehicle, really big. But they didn’t take Jews into 
							the vehicle. They had everything written down, all 
							the surnames, how many here, how many there. They 
							already had a list but I don’t know where they got 
							it from or who had given it to them. So they read 
							out the names and the village leader would go to the 
							addresses. He assembled everyone, it was late 
							afternoon, around four. He designated two or three 
							carts to take them away. They weren’t allowed to 
							take anything with them. If any one of them wanted 
							to take any bundles with them it wasn’t permitted. 
							So they didn’t take anything, and everything was 
							just left there. Afterwards everyone just jumped on 
							their belongings, took what they could. <br>
							<br>
							The Jews owned shops, they were rich, they had cows, 
							horses, the village was practically theirs and it 
							was their work. A Pole or a Ukrainian would work for 
							a zloty a day. It was all mixed up; Polish wives 
							would have Ukrainian husbands, but he wasn’t a 
							Ukrainian, he was a Rusyn, a kind of mix. So they 
							took the Jews away and everything was left behind. 
							There was a shop where the school is. This Jew had 
							an enormous shop, but when one went to the Jew to 
							borrow money for a First Communion outfit, he would 
							just give the outfit, he would simply say ‘give me a 
							penny when you can, if not, then don’t worry’. He 
							wouldn’t tell you to pay him back. They were in fact 
							very honest people. <br>
							<br>
							So these Jews: there was Berko and Josko. Berko was a 
							vet, Josko had a son who was a doctor. My grand-dad 
							suffered a stroke, and he came and saved him, my 
							grand-dad. He would keep friends with other Jews, 
							but he was also a friend of my grand-father’s, they 
							got on very well and he saved him. And they carted 
							them away. I went with the Jews on the cart. <br>
							<br>
							In Olszanica there is a bridge; the first people to 
							arrive there had to dig out ditches for the second 
							lot when they arrived. So they are digging; they 
							stood by them and Berko arrived from over there. 
							Berko had three sons, two daughters and a wife. 
							Josko only had two sons. One son was married; she 
							was called Sunia and they had two children. When 
							these Cossacks arrived they ordered to harness the 
							horses to the cart to take the Jews away to 
							Olszanica over the bridge. There were some bunkers 
							there where they were thrown into. <br>
							<br>
							My grandmother said that grand-dad won’t go alone, 
							he’s a war veteran, he fought for a long time in the 
							Austrian war, he’s weak, you sit by him, go with him 
							there. I was 14, we were weak, frail and 
							undernourished. And these children screamed, and 
							how, how they held onto me: don’t put me there, 
							don’t hand me over. I went with grand-dad over 
							there. How they cried. Dear God, how they were 
							pleading with them not to kill them. The Germans 
							just stood there and one after another they died, in 
							line, machine-gunned down just like that – and in an 
							instant they all just lay there. They fired from 
							this side, from that side, they fell in like pieces 
							of wood placed on a fire. I remembered that for 
							quite a long time and I couldn’t sleep at night. One 
							line would come in from that side, here was the 
							ditch, and from the other side just here. I remember 
							it as if it were yesterday. This line of people who 
							were going to be shot, they would shower lime and 
							others would fire from this side, two Cossacks would 
							open fire with a machine gun, the ones from this 
							side fell with their heads going this way, the 
							others with their heads like that. I remember it as 
							if I was there, if I wasn’t I wouldn’t have been 
							able to make it up, such was the order. <br>
							<br>
							Who did this, who gave the order to wipe them out. 
							They were good people, they were well respected in 
							the village and by the villagers. That’s the way it 
							was, though…</span></p>
