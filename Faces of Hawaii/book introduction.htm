			</font><b><font face="Arial"><br>
			Once, art was an integral part of everyday life for people. The ways 
			we saw our world and each other has been a subject of interpretation 
			by art makers for as long as modern humans have walked the earth. 
			Today, in many of our communities, the connection between art and 
			daily life has dissolved. Art has become the hood ornament on a 
			Cadillac of culture, careening through our communities – a symbol 
			for the good taste of an elite – mimicking originality, and 
			marketing familiar, overworked clichés as commodities. Galleries and 
			critics are the big game hunters who have driven the real human 
			connection which once tempered art, into obscurity. Art of people, 
			by people, for people teeters on the brink of extinction.<br>
			<br>
			In the center of the immense Pacific, stand these Hawaiian Islands, 
			a model for a world grown smaller. Our endemic culture offers 
			interpretation of existence on this volcanic outpost, in story, 
			song, dance and utilitarian object. Adventurers, explorers, 
			colonizers, and proselytizers, from cultures around the world have 
			overlaid that interpretation with their imprint. While art remains 
			prolific in our island community, its nature is fractured. There is 
			little consensus and only marginal involvement of the arts in the 
			tasks of daily life, offering visions of the world we see, and 
			bridges to new worlds that might be.<br>
			<br>
			The camera is an eye, recording momentary consciousness in eye-blink 
			images. There is little guile, cunning or seduction behind which the 
			photographer might hide. The first image we are born to identify is 
			the face. As an icon, we come to know its expression more than any 
			other image in our world. The faces of our community surround us, 
			narrating intention, experience and emotion. In Faces of Hawaii, we 
			have invited the inhabitants of these islands to create a portrait 
			of themselves though the lens of a camera. We hope the totality is a 
			moving picture of the many faces which comprise the single face of 
			our small world, Hawaii.<br>
